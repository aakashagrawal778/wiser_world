										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Economics as an area of study is not just a subject that has academic value but is also one that shapes the systems on the basis of which nations are run, affecting millions of people. It is therefore of great significance to understand the ideas that shaped these systems. Over the years economic thought has gone through several changes as a result of the involvement of different economists. These changes were based on the circumstantial understanding of each individual economist of the situation from separate lenses. Although not a pure science, economics is considered to be a human science. A key aspect of sciences relies on how it progresses as a result of changes through falsification. The progression of economic thought can also be justified by the process of falsification which essentially means to declare a prior theory/knowledge framework false on the grounds of newly attained knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there have been numerous economists over the decades that have proposed varied overviews of economic explanations, however, the history of economics can be outlined through <mark>Classical economics, Keynesian Economics, Monetarist Economics, the Neo-Classical Synthesis and contemporary Economics</mark>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Classical Economics</strong> comprising of economists such as <mark>Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo</mark>, originated in the late 18th century from Adam Smith, matured into different versions/corrections till the late 19th century. Classical economics stemmed from Adam Smith’s theory that the manifestation of an individual&#8217;s self-interest leads to social benefit. David Ricardo, much like Adam Smith, promoted the benefits of free trade, private ownership and a market-based economy through the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp">theory of comparative advantage</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this was applicable in a time when the functioning of an economy was not as complex as it is today and relied majorly on an agrarian outlook, however, it started to be challenged by other economists as the years passed and the outcomes of the Industrial Revolution became more and more pertinent in the society. Disputing the capitalist and market-based structure of an economy, Karl Marx and Friedreich Engels were pioneers in proposing the idea of the communist manifesto which believes that the hierarchy will eventually drive the workers to overthrow their bosses, hence, leading to a classless and stateless system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the opposition to a free market-based economy, the world was <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/capitalism-vs-socialism-relevance-of-marxism-theory-in-todays-world/">dominated by the capitalist system</a> with simultaneous communist uprisings. This gained increased traction during the Russian Revolution and formation of the Soviet Union which was built on the very principle of communism. Alongside the establishment of the Soviet Union, the Great Depression affected nations worldwide and neither were classical economists able to curate a solution to this scenario nor were they able to explain how it happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John Maynard Keynes proposed a solution to this issue through his work, known as <strong>Keynesian Economics</strong>. The main argument in his book was to correct a recession with government intervention in the form of monetary and fiscal policies to increase output and decrease unemployment. Although not entirely in alignment with communism, Keynes’s theory did promote social equality and aimed at reducing the income gap through the kind of measures that were to be taken under government intervention. Therefore, directly challenging the principles of classical economics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the large-scale consequences of the Great Depression, many economies started employing socialism in their systems. This meant that even though private ownership will be possible, there will be government regulation of industries, large markets and public services. With the rise in the acceptance of the Keynesian model, the<strong> Monetarist school of Economics </strong>kept focussing on maintaining price stability and argued that money supply should be increased slowly and predictably to allow for steady growth. This school of thought was more reliant on capitalist ideology as it urged that the economy is far too complex to be manipulated with monetary/fiscal policies and that the Great Depression occurred as a result of botched government policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economics today is an amalgamation of both the Keynesian and Monetarist views and is called the <strong>New Neoclassical Synthesis</strong>. Besides this, contemporary economics has seen a surge in the importance granted to the developmental aspect of the subject. This can be seen through the works of economists such as Amartya Sen and Jean Derez who talk about aspects of the economy that do not directly affect economic growth but rather use development as a pathway to reach the ultimate goal of economic growth. For instance, the definition and relativity of poverty according to Amartya Sen’s capability approach and the importance of health equity as outlined by Jean Derez’s work showcases the growing importance of looking at economics as more than just a subject but rather an institution that needs to cater to the masses for it to be effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the varied theories, schools of thought and progression in Economics it can be inferred that the system is ever-changing as a result of circumstantial findings or realisations, as seen in the case of John Keynes, and the contradictions or attempt at falsification by an opposing school of thought which either leads to a synthesis, as seen in NeoClassical Economics or the complete disposal of a previously accepted notion such as those proposed by Classical Economists.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">COVID 19 has without a doubt had many implications on the Indian economy, as it has on states worldwide. However, the most consequential impact it has had is the migrant workers&#8217; crisis. Given the developing nature of India’s economy, industrialisation is a key aspect in supporting the foundation of the economy. These sectors, such as the mining industry, construction and textile industries are extremely labour intensive and require a large unit of cheap labour. This, therefore, leads to a demand for workers, many of whom migrate from different states of the country in search of jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to COVID, this was definitely beneficial to the economy as it increased the demand for workers fulfilled by migrant workers. This led to a higher rate of employment and the overall increase in the goods and services produced. However, with COVID 19 gaining momentum in India and the imposition of the lockdown, factories and workplaces were shut down resulting in a large number of layoffs. This then left migrant workers with no source of income and no means to return back to their hometown. Foreseeably, it caused major grievances amongst people and the government was forced to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To cater to these grievances the government launched schemes (Yojana’s) and transportation plans to aid a smooth transition between states. The Indian Railways conducted an operation with 4,286 trains (Shramik Trains) to help 58Lakh workers return back to their hometowns. While it successfully covers the issue of migrant workers not being able to sustain themselves in the states they worked in, it then raises an important question of what it means for the economy and employment in varied sectors.</p>



<p>Although economic dualism in a developing country is not unusual, this economic crisis is definitely a significant setback in India’s plans to industrialise for economic growth and overall development of the country. The loss of livelihood combined with the massive reverse flow of workers (from urban to rural areas) leads to the aggravation of a phenomenon called economic dualism, meaning a co-existence of traditional and industrial sets of the economy. The worker’s return to their hometowns will either leave them unemployed or will push them to indulge in manual labour or agricultural labour as a temporary source of income which is most likely less than their wages in the industrial sector. Hence, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor, heightening the involvement of the labour force in the agrarian and rural sector while second handedly also intensifying dualism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pertaining to the same, disruption of the supply chain due to constant lockdowns and lack of workers, increased rate of unemployment, and fluctuations in demand patterns can be anticipated.&nbsp; This is evident in the projections of India’s GDP for the year 20202, which predicts a fall by 4.5% due to COVID and in totality, the impact of the migrant workers&#8217; crisis will undoubtedly be adverse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Political correctness in its definitive sense means the avoidance of actions that marginalise or exclude groups of people that are excluded and discriminated over. An instance of being politically correct can be as simple as asking someone what pronouns they use instead of assuming their gender identity on the basis of their appearance. From being a phrase that was formerly considered one that exhibited wisdom, it is now being attached to negative connotations linked to extreme leftist ideas. With a rise in populist governments across the globe, the idea of political correctness is being rejected by many state heads and governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of the different elucidations attached to “political correctness”, it has led to the formation of two main arguments in its regard; the first being that of having<strong> </strong>freedom of speech and the second being that it is unfruitful in nature and further reinforces the grounds on which individuals are discriminated over.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>PC and Freedom of Speech</strong></h3>



<p>Recently, President Jair Bolsanaro was found making homophobic remarks about Brazil’s tourism industry and how Brazil should not become a “gay tourism paradise”. Not only does this offend an entire community of people who have historically been discriminated against, it also enables citizens of the country to solidify their homophobia towards the LGBTQIA+ community. Inferring from this illustration of political incorrectness, it is safe to assume that such comments made by people, especially those in the political system, endangers the rights and psychological health of marginalised groups of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Individuals opposed to the idea of adhering to political correctness have often retaliated with the argument that it is justified because of their freedom of expression. This then raises the question of whether speech that is meant to offend marginalised groups of the society should be encouraged or not regardless of their political correctness? The answer lies in the motive. Hate speech, such as President Bolsanaro’s comments, is perpetuated with the aim of being derogatory and devaluing the sentiments of another individual. Freedom of expression on the other hand is designed to act as a form of communication and articulation of opinions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, exemplifying that freedom of expression is not just the structural formation of language and words on its own, but it is the value, ideology and symbolism attached to those words that differentiate it from hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>PC and a Global Ethos</strong></h3>



<p>Global ethos refers to the underlying sentiments and beliefs that make up dominant assumptions about a group or society. This can largely be justified by the theory of social constructivism. It suggests that human development, socially, is a product of interpersonal interactions and relationships. These notions are now more relevant than ever due to globalisation and an increase in the influx and efflux of people from different cultural backgrounds into other settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of a globalised world, multiculturalism has now become a limitation for political correctness as a diverse society means a heightened need for inclusivity. In this case, political correctness must be viewed from a linguistic perspective, if it is to be incorporated by the government in their legislative frameworks and dialogues. The idea of political correctness, therefore, relates directly to tolerance which is essential in a globalised state of world order. Although, political correctness does not equal the eradication of social exclusions but it does to a certain degree aid in the process of reducing the phenomena. This further gives rise to the argument of political correctness only being used for formality and not based on morality, hence, disregarding the very idea of diversity and inclusion of different sections of the society, especially those who have been victims to systematic oppression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trump administration is a pure reflection of the aforementioned fundamentals. President Trump has made it very apparent that he does not put any effort into being politically correct. If in case the government under Donald Trump was to pass a politically correct law or legislation the hypocrisy of such an action would be evident since the head of the state does not believe in the notion itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This therefore, demonstrates that political correctness can either partially eliminate inequality and discrimination or can become counterproductive and contrast the very core of its meaning and what it stands for.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>To summarise the different tangents of political correctness, it can be established that political incorrectness can not be justified under the framework of freedom of expression and can only be determined based on the intention and ideology behind what is being said. Additionally, although the narrative of political correctness is one of significance and needs to be treated with utmost importance, however, implementing it without the right ideology behind it dilutes the essence of the principle hence making it ineffectual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/metaethi/">Metaethics</a></strong> is the branch of philosophy that questions morality itself. It delves on the dubiousness of how to tell right from wrong and if morals are objective or subjective. Under the umbrella subject of metaethics, it branches out to moral absolutism and moral relativism. While moral absolutism argues morality can be viewed as black/white, moral relativism explores the subjectivity of different thought processes and how they shape one&#8217;s understanding of morals and ethics. Although a highly abstract way to look at it, metaethics plays a vital role in shaping the notions of universal human rights.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Relativism and Universal Human Rights</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Normative cultural relativism, stemming from moral relativism, is the belief that there are no universally valid moral principles and that moral correctness varies from society to society. In principle, this theory seems ideal and befitting for all. However, the main limitation of this theory lies in the very principle that no individual/society can then be held accountable for any ethical or human rights violations they commit since they are the sole arbiters of those beliefs. One of the most extreme cases of normative cultural relativism would be the Holocaust and how it can not be considered unethical due to the sheer difference in societal principles of morality.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Leading from this very theoretical debate arises an obstacle to curate a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/762182"><strong>universal framework</strong> </a>for human rights conduct to be followed by states. With an increasingly globalised state of world order and the involvement of states in inter-governmental forums, the need for a universal framework for the code of human rights is essential. Complex interdependence and the ability of states to intervene in the affairs of other states have made a universal guideline necessary. More importantly, the acceptance of such frameworks that meet the common ground with varied cultures is essential for states to implement them.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Universal or Western?</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is one of the most sought after frameworks of human rights that have been put into effect by the UN as a method to enable the accessibility to human rights. Although the UDHR does not base itself off of any specific culture, it is often looked at as a westernised idea of human rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The thematic grounding of the UDHR is based on the individual with a focal point on individual rights. The idea of community and society relating to one&#8217;s rights is not an idea that has been explored or demonstrated in it. The neglect towards a utilitarian approach in this framework makes it unfitting for cultures that believe in a communal approach instead of an individualistic one. Analogously, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24866722"><strong>Asian societies</strong></a> are based on the heterogenous communal approach, often built on the foundation of religion. This lays special emphasis on the importance of a family unit and the idea of societal unity.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Western countries have often been held accountable for practicing cultural imperialism, especially after the end of colonialism, cultural dominance through indirect channels became a mode of asserting supremacy. The deviation from the Asian perspective further reinforces the practice of cultural imperialism and puts the entire framework of the UDHR up for question on the grounds of western power play and the imposition of western beliefs through international forums, masked as a way to contribute to the greater good.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Examining the approaches to universal rights, it is safe to deduce that the need for them is imperative and needs some aspects of moral absolutism to put the same into effect. However the acceptance and inclusion of all cultures need to be viewed as an equivalent of the former reason stated, pertaining to cultural relativism, and due to the absolute presence of diversity in cultures.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The Korean War from 1950 to 1953 had devastating effects on the population of both the nations due to their hostile division. Families were torn apart with no form of communication and left South Korea in a state of poverty. While this impact in itself was colossal, South Korea had the added burden of not being left with any natural resources to revive their economy. This, therefore, led to South Korea being an underdeveloped economy, completely reliant on its agrarian produce and foreign aid from the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The South Korean economic model, also known as the Miracle of the Han River refers to the rapid economic growth in South Korea after the Korean War. In less than two decades South Korea saw a pragmatic shift in their economy and is currently the 12th largest economy in the world according to its GDP.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gKlXLvIyw5ADXY72MgYKrY59j_7mk6XNUKs4ZwN1sQA1HCX4X0hZo0IJe1Lv-3QuUQzN90OOus9UysHcZv04ZI6xNyc9G5o3yi92dxxCxwyUZLlAC_PiHp45JUct5B5b_h3C0mbf" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>This heightening of South Korea’s economy can be factored by 3 principal factors:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Investments in rebuilding an education system and innovations</li><li>Eliminating an agrarian economy</li><li>Withholding dynastical mega corporations&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Prior to the Second World War and the Korean War, South Korea had the foundation laid for a vocational training system. However, this was disrupted by the aftermath of the wars and completely shattered their system. Resultantly, the government started focussing on rebuilding their educational and vocational training system with the sole purpose of increasing employment which would have the dual benefits of eliminating poverty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation started with compulsory school attendance from ages 6 to 15 and in the 1970’s South Korea set an equalisation policy which aimed at reducing competition to get into prestigious secondary schools. In “equalisation zones” students were taken into consideration for a prestigious secondary education by a lottery system. Although many parents were opposed to this idea since these students were not admitted on the basis of merit, this policy-induced parents from equalisation zones, which were primarily regions that were less developed, to send their children to school and fulfill the minimum requirements to be eligible for this policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A significant chunk of South Korea’s economic restoration post the war is attributed to the willingness of citizens to enroll themselves into the educational system while also having the flexibility to opt for vocational training after secondary education. This was made possible by the government&#8217;s investment in human capital which promoted innovation and developed a good workforce for the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings the model to its second aim of eliminating an agriculture and cultivation based economy. South Korea started focusing on industrialising its rural areas and bringing them out of the realm of subsistence farming. This happened as a result of increased literacy rates and investments in infant industries by the government which led to more job opportunities. Hence, bringing citizens out of villages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to investments in building human capital, South Korean ties with the US majorly helped the country in picking up its pace as far as investments in infant industries are concerned. During the Vietnam War, South Korea contributed by providing troops to the US military. In return America harboured trade ties with South Korea which increased the cash flow into the country, hence, increasing the government&#8217;s revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After achieving the first two goals of its plan, the South Korean government was now in a position to carry out mass production, at a globalised level. However, Japan was already a regional supplier of electronics, automobiles and technological gadgets, all of which Korea had expertise in. This initially made it challenging for South Korea to gain an edge over the Japanese suppliers. Gradually, due to Japan’s spurge of development, the costs increased which therefore helped South Korea gain a comparative advantage in the aspect of supplying cheaper produce on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this plan resulting in continued growth of the South Korean economy, the government now moved to its third aim of the economic model. This aim consisted of sustaining the progress and the firms involved in the growth of the country. The government started backing “Chaebols” which refers to family-run businesses that are passed on and run within the family. In the late ‘70s, the government realised the rate at which these companies were growing and assured support by ensuring a cash flow from the government&#8217;s side and urged the firms to focus on growing. Today these family dynasties have become mega-monopolistic corporations, run namely by Samsung, LG and Hyundai. These three companies alone are responsible for 2/3rd’s of the entire Korean economy and produce for the three main industries of the country- ship manufacturing, automobiles and electronics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst this strategy to make the economy reliant on just three major corporations has turned out to be extremely lucrative for South Korea but it has now become too big to fail. This essentially means that in case of an economic crash or an obstruction in the mechanism of any of these companies, thousands of people will lose their jobs, stocks will fall and the economy will most likely experience a recession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic gaining momentum globally, the South Korean economy, like many others, faced a recession and saw a fall in their GDP for the first time in 17 years. Nonetheless, the South Korean Finance Minister is optimistic that the nation will be back on track by the third quarter much like China. Since South Korea does not have a geographical terrain as large as China and the natural resources, the government will have to continue their already undertaken policies of fostering education and innovation to revive its economy once again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Public health diplomacy and its changing dynamics have gained increased traction from states due to COVID-19. This crisis has become an opportunity for states to assert their dominance on Inter-Governmental Organisations and broaden their sphere of influence on non-state actors. With China’s intensifying mingling in the affairs of the UN and its subsidiaries over the past decade through funding, the US deemed the UN a party to a conflict of interest in the ongoing US-China tensions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>USA and its Historical Ties with the United Nations and its Subsidiaries</strong></h3>



<p>Starting from Franklin D Roosevelt in 1954, the USA has shown signs of solidarity with the UN and the United States’ voice in decisions of the UN has always played a pivotal role, especially since it is one of the P5 members. Conjointly, along with its allegiance to the United Nations, the US has been a significant actor in the projects carried out by the WHO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades the United States has been a committed partner of the World Health Organisation in aiding global health emergencies and has financially supported its prospects. The US was the number one donor for the 2016-2017 programme budget and for many previous years. Both state and individual donations combined, the total donations made to the WHO that rooted from the States has been a total of US$ 945.6 million in WHO for the 2016-2017 period. And the contributions from the United States were made up for over 76% of voluntary funding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="234" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-5-donors-1024x234.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2264" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-5-donors-1024x234.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-5-donors-300x69.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-5-donors-768x175.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-5-donors.png 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="142" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-10-graph2-1024x142.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2265" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-10-graph2-1024x142.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-10-graph2-300x42.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-10-graph2-768x107.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top-10-graph2.jpg 1331w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.who.int/about/planning-finance-and-accountability/financing-campaign/us-impact">WHO</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The United Nations was built upon the principle of global syndication and interdependence, however, with the USA’s interventions over the years and its weighty contributions have to some extent eroded the UN’s legitimacy. Although the foundation of the United Nations is that of a liberal idea with the notion of co-dependence and overall prosperity of both big and small state actors, it has been proven time and again that for many states, especially ones that are permanent members, like the US, have used the United Nations as a forum to further their neo-realist agendas wherein non-state actors are only a pathway to increase power and legitimacy and not multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>China’s Participation and COVID</strong></h3>



<p>Although China’s funding in the United Nations has been increasing each year over the last decade, its contribution to the World Health Organization has especially seen a rise pertaining to the current Coronavirus pandemic which originated in China’s Hubei province. Hence, making China’s say in the matter that of much more significance in comparison to any other state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The WHO has appreciated China’s efforts and action towards this pandemic publicly and stated that their response made a major impact on the spread of the virus globally. However, there were many criticisms in regards to the same. Specifically by the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The WHO’s sudden inclination towards China with the arrival of this pandemic was questioned by many and ticked off the US as a result. The role of the World Health Organization is to maintain diplomacy and be an advisory organ for states to act upon at their discretion. This has been the preliminary basis of debate over why the organisation is in the wrong for potentially siding with China and not criticising them for notifying other states much later than the first traces of the virus were found, in December 2019. In addition to this, China’s circulation of faulty safety kits also added to the narrative of China deceiving other nations and not painting a clear enough picture for states to act upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The World Health Organisation’s backing towards China potentially has its roots in the increased funding by China to the UN as a whole. China is now the second-largest contributor to the United Nations funds amongst the G77 countries. This, therefore, makes it a notable member whose presence in the United Nations can not be forgone.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>President Trump’s Response</strong></h3>



<p>On the 7th of July, 2020, President Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the World Health Organisation. This decision faced a lot of opposition from opponent parties given the WHO’s role in fighting global health emergencies that the world is currently living through and the fact that the United States has one of the highest numbers of cases globally.</p>



<p>Not only will this move have a detrimental impact on the United States status as far as the number of cases goes, but this can also result in a global setback of vaccine development in which the US could have been a major stakeholder and contributor. While the Trump administration has already cut off all funding, the withdrawal process will take approximately a year. However, the 2020 presidential candidate, Joe Biden has vowed to reverse this action and be part of the organisation again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This decision further goes on to prove the USA’s intentions with non-state actors and how they are linked to notions of neorealism and are used as a tool to safeguard self-interest rather than build on global interdependence through collaborative measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the decision to pull out of the WHO is also an indication of what US-China relations will be like post-COVID, as prior to this it was still an unclear picture. However, pulling out of the WHO as a result of backing China is a clear enough signal that at least under the Trump Administration these tensions will continue and are not going to change in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Regardless of the gravitas of this situation, this move does not come as a shock after the US pulled out of the Paris Agreement. Inferring from the series of events that have taken place before and after this monumental decision issued by the US government, it is safe to assume that this is in relation to President Trump&#8217;s prolonged pattern of claiming that the United States is being taken advantage of by intergovernmental organisations such at WHO and NATO and this action is one of the biggest showcases of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United Nations has played a pivotal role in the international arena and has contributed to some of the most significant events in the history of International relations, pertaining to its role as one of the biggest Inter-Governmental Organisation (IGO). As an ode to the <strong>UN’s 75th anniversary</strong> this year it is of the essence to analyse its toil over the tenure of 75 years. With that being established, the United Nations has had its fair share of shortcomings, in addition to their achievements and has indirectly played a significant role in shaping the world order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, not only has the United Nations solved conflicts but has also catered to humanitarian crises, a number of which have been successful. The Polio Eradication Initiative led by WHO in India has been one of the most effective health campaigns carried out by WHO. In 2009, India had the highest number of polio cases in the world. This <strong>public health emergency</strong> was especially challenging to tackle due to India’s population density, poverty rate and poor sanitation. Given the rising cases of polio and the challenges the Indian government was faced with, the WHO’s intervention in 2010 made a lasting impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;In the procedure of eliminating Polio, the WHO introduced <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-25709362"><strong>bivalent oral polio vaccines</strong></a>, the implementation of which was excellently supported by the Indian government. The prompt response to this led to a nationwide inoculation drive and polio vaccines became a must and were being heavily implemented in every state through micro-planning. Despite the complexities of reaching out to every section of the society in a diverse country like India and refusal of getting vaccinated the UN subsidiary in amalgamation with the Indian government led to a sharp fall in the numbers of reported polio cases.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="262" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/72245888_polio_india_624.jpg" alt="united nations" class="wp-image-1906" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/72245888_polio_india_624.jpg 410w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/72245888_polio_india_624-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></figure></div>



<p>Although the UN has made crucial contributions towards the betterment of certain aspects, it has, however, failed to prevent war in some instances and has had counterproductive peacekeeping missions. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been victim to the UN’s inefficiency and sub-par performance during the peacekeeping mission set out by the UN for the DRC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1999 the UN started operation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/opinion/the-un-in-congo-the-failure-of-a-peacekeeping-mission.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap"><strong>MONUC </strong></a>and sent peacekeeping forces to Congo due to its civil war and the rising threat to human rights it posed. The Congolese Civil War gained traction from its neighbouring states, but the most vital role was played by the Rwandan Army. to counter the same Congo and the UN pledged to remove insurgents in return for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops. In spite of this Rwanda did not comply since they felt the pledge was not upheld and went on to order the UN to withdraw its peacekeeping forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shockingly, the<strong> UN complied and withdrew</strong> its forces from the region. Resultantly, the Rwandan Army’s militaristic involvement in Congo increased and caches of weapons in the DRC were found in the following year. Rooting from the UN’s very explicit inaction and resistance towards changing the status quo, this mission by the United Nations is considered one of the most consequential and colossal failures of the organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of its performance, the UN has undoubtedly played a key role in shaping world order and contributing to changing the <strong>balance of power</strong>. Over the years IGO’s have become a platform for states to posture themselves in the international arena and flex their muscles. While the realist beliefs refute the importance of non-state actors and any means of power that is not militaristic or economic in nature, there has been a steady growth in the investments made in the United Nations due to its magnitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China being one of the most prominent states to visibly express their interest in investing and following through has definitely added to its soft power and sphere of influence. China is now the second-largest<a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/china-un-mission/%23:~:text=China%2520contributed%2520a%2520total%2520of,US%2520(amount%2520and%2520percent)."><strong> contributor </strong></a>in financial investments in the form of troops to the UN amongst G77 countries. In 2015 Xi Jinping pledged to supply 8,000 peacekeepers and after withholding that pledge, they committed to a 10 year $1 billion China-UN Peace and Development Fund for peacekeeping operations.</p>



<p>China’s sudden involvement and constant support towards the UN, financially, is no coincidence. By gradually becoming a salient aspect of the mechanism and functioning of the United Nations, China has gained an upper hand in all the conflicts and human rights violations attached to it. Taiwan’s position as a state and not being recognised as a nation-state by the United Nations, now seems far from happening due to the<strong> UN’s dependency on China </strong>for financial aid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2020 being the UN’s 75th anniversary and still being a major stakeholder in the system of states and their functioning, the aforementioned arguments and cases are a pure reflection of the United Nations work over the years and paints a clear picture of its performance and potential actions in the future.&nbsp;</p>
