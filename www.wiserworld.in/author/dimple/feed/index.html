										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about Japan is World War 2 and its devastating effects on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now after a long journey from those tragic days Japan has established itself as one of the world’s biggest and advanced countries along with a stable economy and high-end technology. There is another thing about Japan, which makes the country famous all over the world, generating a buzz-worthy status to its soft power, that soft power is named as <em>Anime</em>, as the name suggests, it<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-3338e426-1ed8-4ac3-b366-230b909aa0da"></mark> refers to animation.</p>



<p>Anime is the animation or cartoon particularly made in Japan with a huge fan following all over the world. &nbsp;This art form covers serious topics than usual cartoon animations, not only does it attract children but also young adults and teens. It is a huge concept covering different genres like comedy, romance, drama, pornography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the animes share the same kind of appearance which is different from the other cartoons and animations. The editors, the designers, the creators all strictly follow a peculiar artwork for anime. The characters have big eyes, highlighted bright colourful hairs, and chick dressing sense. They also have exaggerated emotional expressions and <a href="https://jw-webmagazine.com/best-anime/">gestures</a> which are specifically meant for the anime characters. Many of the characters are inspired by the characters of Disney like seven dwarfs, Micky mouse, mini mouse, and so on. So we really cannot confirm where the idea of big eyes, well- endowed figures have come from.</p>

<h2>The Anime Culture and Its Popularity</h2>



<p>The anime culture is purely Japanese. This culture was born in Japan along with the birth of <em>Otaku</em> subcultures in the 1960s. It has made a huge impact on its own country. The citizens and government of Japan constructed different kinds of statues, landmarks, and sites for the local citizens and also for the tourists. It is such a dominant side of Japan that many companies, business, brands, and organizations use anime characters in the advertisement, slogans, packaging, snacks and so on. Some brands have even launched anime-theme products for the customers, they are surprisingly doing very well in the markets of Japan as well as abroad. These markets are mainly the younger market, where audiences are more curious about the mascots or anime characters featuring in the product more than the product itself. It has become a household cultural trend among kids and young adults ever <a href="https://gogonihon.com/en/blog/a-small-glimpse-into-history-of-japanese-anime/">since </a>the nineties along with pokemon, Digimon, yu-gi-oh.</p>



<p>The inspiration for anime has partially come from Japanese comic books, <em>manga</em>. Japanese culture can be seen in many TV shows. High schools in Japan are as similar as shown in anime. Staying in traditional ryokan inns, eating with chopsticks, the same kind of accessories, quite the same kind of hair and dressing styles are seen in the common people of Japan. There is a character called Hatsune Miku, Japan&#8217;s first Vocaloid singer, who has a huge fan base and craze over the Japanese young audience. There are also many realistic shows of anime that accurately blend Japanese culture into art. A Japanese village Manoyama has an anime based on itself named Sakura Quest. The Ambition of Oda Nobuna is based on another real man of Japan’s history called Nobunaga.</p>



<p>A massive part of the Japanese cultural industry, their animation industry is the country&#8217;s third-largest industry, bringing nearly $20 billion a year. It is visible everywhere across the country. As we can tell that most of the Japanese people are a fan of anime, the country is filled with people who are mad about manga as wekk<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-43b08fd9-d191-41a1-9c2f-1a18b0fdf0f4"></mark> and are really into otaku culture.</p>



<h2>Anime’s World Domination</h2>



<p>The world of anime is full of the genre, variety, and a lot of complexity. It is an incredibly rich culture. It<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-3d37aa71-b371-4580-bc7e-57429601d96f"></mark> is not only famous in Asian countries but also has an expanding fanbase among Indians, Americans, Europeans, and many more. An amazing thing about the animation industry is that 60% of all animated shows across the world come from Japan. Marketed to a huge global audience, it has been growing higher and higher in terms of popularity, income, and fame. Apart from providing the biggest selling film in Japan, Korea, China, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, it has become the most likeable among the western countries.</p>



<p>When it comes to animation, Disney has always been the priority of many audiences. With the rising popularity of anime, Disney has decided to put a Pokemon theme park in Disneyland.</p>



<p>Astro-boy, Dragon Ball, Howl’s Moving Castle, Detective Conan, Cowboy Bebop are very famous and popular in the world. People try to make their anime characters inspired by the characters from these series. Many of the popular anime series and films are taken to be remade in different film industries in different languages. The fantasy world of anime is just taking over us all with lots of colours, moments, and sounds, and songs bring these cartoon characters to life. Shockingly this fantasy world of anime and its characters has more fan following and popularity than many real celebrities.</p>



<p>Anime and the USA has an old connection since the 60s, American <a href="https://jpninfo.com/31964">fandom </a>has always been loyal to the anime series since then. Channels like Cartoon Network and Sci-Fi programmed anime blocks, series, movies from the 90s. Anime has already taken over Netflix, Amazon Prime. Apart from these anime has a specific app for streaming named HULU. Social media has been a great platform to know about anime characters, their specialty. Halloween costumes, memes, sites like makegirlsmoe, cosplay community are just all about anime and its impact.</p>



<h2>The Soft Power of Japan: Anime</h2>



<p>The love of Japanese people is and perhaps always will be anime.  A lot of ceremonies are celebrated in Japan with the presence of an anime mascot and theme. Before the K-pop industry in South Korea became popular, anime was already there with its immense popularity, huge fanbases, and sky-high viewership. The multi-billion dollar industry is quite a strong tower in <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/case-study-of-the-japanese-economy/">Japan’s economy</a>. Japan’s contribution to the world in terms of cars, video games, fashion, and anime is quite impressive.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan has lots of brands, products specifically themed in anime for the market with the positive point of the blue ocean market. Well in the field of tourism anime has been a great plus point. Besides the reflection of Japanese culture, food, dressing style in anime already attract the tourist but different kinds of anime concert, anime-themed markets, mascot, statues, art camps are way more effective in promoting tourism to Japan as well as influencing pop-cultures. Places like Tokyo Anime Centre; holds daily radio with an anime character, the electric city Akihabara known as the otaku destination, J-talk Tokyo, Tokyo character street, Dogo onsen, Otome Road are hubs for tourists, people all over the world&#8217;s visits these places for their craving for anime, game worlds and many more. Tourism is becoming a high hit in Japan due to its influence all over the world.</p>

<p>Being the third biggest largest economy in the world, with the rising soft power, culture, and diplomatic relations, Japan is doing a great deal in enhancing its international standing. Japan has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190610-did-manga-shape-how-the-world-sees-japan">invested </a>billions of dollars in cultural exchange and teaching of the Japanese language, which is a great success to date and giving a major boost to the economy of the country. A lot of the young generation coming to Japan in search of work, education, and to learn the otaku culture is a great deal for its economy and culture. The root of anime all across the world becoming a major soft power bouncer to the country. The Japanese government has exploited the power of its animation industry to make the country’s economy stronger. The Japanese government has made a lot of investment to make anime-themed towns and museums for tourist attractions. This not only helps the tourism, or work section but also brings a lot’s of business collaboration from the world. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rise of Japanese programs is also helping japan to promote their pop-culture in quite an impressive way. The formation and promotion of J-pop just like K-pop is one such example. It’s kind of popular among the younger generation.</p>



<p>“Art and culture play a vital role in globalization. It is a way to get your message across, an effective yet discreet way to create friends – opposite to the alarm and fear resulting from coercion.’’ <a href="https://www2.palomar.edu/impactmagazine/2018/06/28/anime-more-than-asian-pop-culture/">said </a>the commissioner at the Japanese government’s cultural agency, Seiichi Kundu.<br>‘’Japanese pop culture is a gateway to the deeper and more traditional Japanese culture’’ <a href="https://www.globalasia.org/v6no1/feature/cool-japan-soft-power_asger-r%C3%B8jle-christensen">said</a>, Ambassador Kondo.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Anime has become the soft power to Japan indeed. The paradox is that the concept of japan’s soft power is not very controversial. People back in Japan and abroad discussed it as a soft power very little. Not like other soft powers, it is not offensive, it is loved by all. It is creating a new pride and confidence in confronting the issue of soft power to the world. Anime’s emphasis on cultural diplomacy is quite agreeable to the whole world. The tourism market, education sector, learning camps are rising daily as lots of people across the globe are getting attracted towards Japan. The people who are still at home trying to learn Japanese, buying many anime-themed products, kind of being prepared for their first visit to Japan, helps the Japanese government to gain more revenues hence improving their economy.</p>

<p>K-pop, the popular music that originated in South Korea is taking over the whole world with the raging popularity of K-pop groups like BTS, Black Pink, GOT7, Monsta X, and many more. The whole K-pop idea was introduced as a distinct traineeship modal in the South Korean music industry which is now followed by the rest of the entertainment industry. The growing popularity of the K-pop industry is not only promoting the Korean culture over the world, even into countries like Chile, Afghanistan, and Middle East but is also making a strong impact on the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/decoding-south-koreas-economy/">South Korean economy</a>. The way this industry is growing, K-pop is sure to propel the South Korean economy in the years ahead.</p>



<p>So, the whole concept of K-pop dominance all over the world is known as “<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/bts-tops-billboard-100-list-how-k-pop-helped-korea-improve-its-economy/articleshow/65266543.cms">Hallyu</a>”, a Chinese word that stands for the Korean wave of pop culture. The continuous growth of Hallyu resulted in increased distribution and consumption of Korean content through platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and SNS. Even the incredible and first-ever success of director Bong Joon-Ho’s film <em>Parasite</em> also helped in Hallyu content and the Korean film/entertainment in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>A Little Into Hallyu Background and Present State</strong></h2>



<p>In 1992, the Korean Culture and Tourism Institute send a copy of a drama to play into the other countries, with the support of the South Korean government. The government helps these industries to go and other things also. The projects that helped in the spread of Hallyu are – boys over flower, my seesy girl, Swiri, Autumn in my heart also the songs SHINee&#8217;s ring ding ding, PSY Gangnam Style, Rain’s bad boy. These become popular not only in the parts of Asia but also among the youth of other countries like the US and the UK. When it comes to Hallyu there are five main factors one shouldn&#8217;t forget. The impact starts with lifting the ban on foreign travel for Korean citizens, along with Korean chaebols restructuring. Samsung also considers another main factor of the Korean wave. The rise of Samsung was another era for the South Korean economy and Hallyu. Branding of Korean companies and banning censorship lows, giving opportunities to other citizens to come and learn K-pop is another highlight of the K-pop era. As Barak Obama <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2199-8531/3/4/22/pdf">said </a>the entertainment industry of K-pop in South Korea is the government’s priority.</p>



<p>Every Korean brand promotes its ad along with a K-pop idol or actor, which helps when the protagonist of the ad goes overseas, they help the brand to promote overseas. The wave of Korean pop culture has great support from the government from the past. Korean pop culture has a great impact on Asian countries like China, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. The Hallyu itself a mandarin word. The K-pop industry is joined by trainees from China, Thailand, and Japan. Many of K-pop group consists of Chinese, Thai and Japanese members along with Korean members with their nationality abroad, which helps them to gain popularity among the countries and reach achievements. Many Korean idols, singers, actors have also signed many sub-labels in other countries due to the increase of Hallyu. The rising popularity of the entertainment industries not only promoting Hallyu but also giving a high rise to the Korean government.&nbsp; The growth of the Korean wave over the last two decades is fantastic and giving a major impact on the Korean economy. </p>



<h2><strong>K-popnomy</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to the K-pop music industry, five to eight K-pop music labels are offering a huge range in the Korean economy. Such labels are Big Hit Entertainment, SM Entertainment, JYP Official, Starship Official, and many more. The chairman of SM Entertainment, Lee Soo-man told a recent seminar that he believed k- pop would grow through technological innovation and even Hallyu celebrities in all powered avatars could even become part of our lives. According to Korea foundation president Lee gum, Hallyu has not only become a global content but an asset to South Korea’s pubic diplomacy. CNN published the article with the headline after the sudden popularity of K-pop song Gangnam Style by PSY released in 2012, “Korean wave of pop culture swipes across Asia.”</p>



<p>Being the uppermost country with the determined goal to become the most popular culture leading exporter South Korea along with its government supporting the entertainment industries to grow higher and reach audiences all over the world. Also, we can say it’s the way to develop the soft power of the country. With the blessing of the biggest cultural phenomena across Asia and another part of the globe Hallyu, Korea expands its businesses, culture, and country image.</p>

<p>Korean merchandise exports to a country respond strongly to lagged TV program exports to the same destination but mostly in sectors characterized by consumer products. These include UN Broad Economic Categories like food and beverages, and other consumer goods Korean annual exports reports, Korean products such as cosmetics, food, fashion, electronics, and mobile phones are exports at a higher rate, which helped in raising the bar by 34.7%. The exports also include the merch by the K-pop idols, groups, the brand product they used to promote also exports at a high rate. Such change of consumer preferences has occurred through several ways as supported by numerous survey results and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200309-the-soft-power-roots-of-k-pop">reports </a>by the MoFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), KOTRA (Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency), and KOFICE (Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange).</p>



<p>First, foreign consumers form favorable national images of Korea while watching the dramas as they naturally experience a chance to learn and appreciate the Korean culture. In the past, people tend to associate national images of South Korea negatively with the Korean War or North Korea, but nowadays such images are giving way to the charming, fun, and lively images of entertainments and state-of-the-art technologies. Such a change of national image enhances consumer preferences for products with the “Made in Korea” label. The entertainment industry helps in the economy by their image, ad, and role in the different brands and also promoting the tourist view of South Korea.</p>



<p>Along with the South Korean government promoting Hallyu the K-pop being the most strong soft power to the country making South Korea a destination of investment and commercial zone for many businesses all over the world. The massive popularity, immense government support, and running television station, broadcasting station helping the K-pop industry to provide a stable and strong economy to the South Korean even in the time of Covid-19.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">After UK left EU, a long time of three years of bartering still it has not yet decided how to end the trade and tension between the two, after a long time of agreeing to new rules for how to live, work and trade together the leaders are still negotiating over time to reach a deal after Brexit.</p>



<p>Let’s travel back to the past, what is actually Brexit is and why it’s catching the whole news at once. United Kingdom joining EEC (European economic community) in 1973 as a  predecessor to the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/european-union-an-economic-case-study/">European Union</a> brings a lot of spilt. The Guardian wrote in an editorial on January 1, 1973 “ The journey into Europe will be bumpy and discordant.</p>



<h2>A Quick Glimpse Into the Past Events Which Led to Brexit</h2>



<p>During the WW1 and WW2, the European countries were also going through some conflicts in between them, slowly those conflicts turned out to be bloody wars. Simply, to rescue the neighbouring countries of Europe, EU comes into power with its founding members Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. European Union was originally the European Economic Community (EEC) created by the treaty of Paris in 1957. The United Kingdom joined in 1973. The main purpose of the European Union was to form a single European political entity and maintain a peaceful balance between all member countries with four basic freedoms regarding the transportation of goods, trade between member countries, common currency and free movement of people. In simpler terms, the EU consists of a group of European countries that acts as a single economic unit in the world economy.&nbsp; EU provides a peaceful balance to the countries and help to make a stronger economy of each country and offers opportunities to rely on each other. However, the EU also strictly maintains some<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b17f108-2cbd-44de-a829-d1bd910faa2e"> rules and regulation </a>on these member countries.</p>



<p>When it comes to the UK leaving EU, there’s a lot of news going on. To cover the huge topic in a go, the understanding of UK and EU is a long but bumpy journey and is much important. The United Kingdom joined the EU for the better economic and peaceful life of the citizen. After two years of UK joining EU brings a debate around into two parties, one section of the UK were not really happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU.&nbsp; According to that section of society, the EU has been a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-47213842">toxic issue</a> in British politics.&nbsp;They always fear that the EU may hamper the sovereignty of the UK and also can bring fundamental conflict. Britain&#8217;s future with the EU had no luck, that was strongly believed by a larger section of society, also many citizens and politician were not happy with the rules and regulation imposed by the EU. Although the other half who were not very happy with the freedom that comes other Britain’s exit of EU, the youth of Britain is torn between their idea of what Britain could be and the reality of what it is. So to make a decision and end the debate and protest between the two parties of The United Kingdom, a referendum took place in 2016. On 23 June 2016, British citizens were called to cast their vote on the subject of the UK’s membership in the European Union that had a remarkable turnout of 72 per cent of the total electoral voted YES to the Brexit.</p>



<h2>Xmas with Brexit Trade Deal</h2>



<p>For the British and European Parliaments to ratify a trade agreement in an orderly fashion before the Brexit transition period expires on New Year’s Eve. The UK insists that it should trade with the bloc with as few restraints as possible. The EU demands that Britain stick to EU rules to ensure fair competition.</p>



<p>After the long discussions, talks and conference call about 90 minutes between the prime minister Boris Johnson and the president Ursula von der Leyen, with the spirit of Christmas 2020, EU and UK comes to finalize their situation with ‘a lose-lose situation’ the deal is about signed in December 31st 2020.  The  EU’S chief negotiator Michel Barnier express regret saying there is no winner in Brexit. Ursula has said, &#8220;parting is always bitter and sweet, after successful negotiation journey throughout Brexit, the deal has been made in the Xmas eve, I feel satisfaction and relief.&#8221; A bittersweet moment has emerged in the air of the UK. Although the youth are not happy with the whole idea of Brexit but the deal has been made which is better then no deal, if the deal did not happen the situation in the UK will be worst. The deal prevented some worst situation for the United Kingdom. So after this long time with lots of news, protest and discussion, along with the deal made, the UK has become a completely unchartered territory. Britain is free from the EU, and the European Union has lost a member from its union.  A lot of compromise from both sides made possible the Brexit trade deal.</p>



<p>The deal that has made between the UK and EU stated that European boat will still drop nets in British water, giving up only 25% of their catch quotas as fishing becomes the most important part of the economy of both also the Brexit trade deal.  Due to the Brexit deal, the EU is going to reduce quota as EU vessels can get in and the UK can go back. No tariffs or quotas on the movement of goods tariff-free or free trade as there are non-tariff barriers lots of from filling. So there will be no tariffs and quotas but some bureaucratic barriers to trade. There’s quite more stuff including the UK going to stay in certain EU’s programs, free movements of person will be removed along with goods and services, also the Brexit deal does not provide financial equivalence to UK’s economy. After all this there will be a partnership council is going to take over.</p>



<p>After the Brexit deal the leaders of both UK and EU on the positive side of maintaining the strong relationship between the both UK and EU, also looking forward to more stability and certainty towards a new beginning with a new security and trade deal post Brexit, which runs to 2,000 pages.&nbsp;</p>
