<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">When people are exposed to the threat of death or to the actual situation they may develop stress disorders. Being exposed to the death of our loved ones or any other traumatic events leads to the development of stress symptoms and in severe cases led to the development of disorder like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  If individual experience PTSD diagnosis then they face problems such as the intrusion of distressing reminders of the events, dissociative symptoms such as feeling numb or detached from others, avoidance of situations that might serve as reminders o the event and hyperarousal such as sleep disturbances or irritability. These symptoms can last for months after the event.  It also includes negative changes in cognition including memory loss, excessive self-blaming, distance from others and inability to experience positive emotions.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In the 1980s, when the diagnosis of PTSD was added in DSM the media drew attention to the psychological aftereffects of combat experienced by Vietnam War veterans. It was the most publicized but not the only one. Reports of psychological dysfunction following exposure to combat emerged after the Civil War and received increased attention with conditions called shell shock, traumatic neurosis, combat stress and combat fatigue. Survivors also were reported to suffer long term psychological effects including the “survivor syndrome” of chronic depression, anxiety and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 6.8 per cent with a yearly prevalence of 3.5 per cent. The symptoms of PTSD and related disorder such as depression can persist for many years.  Women are more likely to develop it than men.</p>



<h3><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are four types of symptoms but they are different for everyone. The types are as follows:-</p>



<ol><li><strong>Avoidance Symptoms</strong>&#8211; It happens when an individual tries to avoid the situation or people that trigger the traumatic event. They do not discuss the event with anyone. It leads to a loss of interest in activities and getting emotionally detached. They also try to stay from places and objects that remind them of the event. Example, if you lost someone in a plane crash you might stop travelling by plane.</li><li><strong>Re-experiencing symptoms </strong>are like flashbacks which make the person feel like they are going through the event again. It involves Nightmares, Frightening Thoughts, Fearful thoughts or intense mental or physical reactions.</li><li><strong>Arousal and Reactivity symptoms</strong>&#8211; It includes problems such as irritability, difficulty in sleeping, frustration and anger outbursts, feeling tense or anxious. Individual also face jumpiness or they get startled by the thought of the event, difficulty in concentration and self- destructive behaviours such as rash driving.</li><li><strong>Cognition and mood symptoms</strong>&#8211; It includes negative changes in feelings and beliefs. Other problems are memory loss, feeling hopeless for future and difficulty in maintaining interpersonal relationships. Constant feeling of guilt and blame. They feel like leaving alone.</li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The symptoms for children are different from adults. Children face problems such as-</p>



<ol><li>Separation Anxiety can lead to Separation Anxiety Disorder</li><li>Loss of skills such as toilet training</li><li>Sleep problems</li><li>Phobias and anxieties</li><li>Narrating out trauma trough help of plays, stories or drawings</li><li>Pains with no actual cause</li><li>Aggression</li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Physical symptoms such as sweating, headache, dizziness, stomach ache, weak immune system are also faced by people.</p>



<h3><strong>CAUSE</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A traumatic experience is an external event but researches propose that traumatic events may lead to changes in the brain that make it hypersensitive to possible danger in the future. Individuals with PTSD experience alterations in the hippocampus, the structure responsible for memory. As a result, a person is unable to distinguish between harmful situation from the ones in which real trauma occurred. Levels of hormones responsible for ‘flight or fight’ situation are different than a person not having PTSD. Other causes are as follows:-</p>



<ol><li>Family History of depression and PTSD</li><li>Lack of coping skills</li><li>A lot of stress in daily life</li><li>Sexual Abuse</li><li>History of anxiety or other mental illness and substance abuse</li><li>Careers such as police or military that lead to traumatic events</li><li>Lack of support</li></ol>



<h3><strong>DIGNOSIS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">PTSD can increase chances for disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorder, substance abuse and suicide. Diagnosis should be done under medical professionals. To be diagnosed with PTSD a person should meet the criteria listed under DSM by the American Psychological Association. They should have at least one re-experiencing, avoidance symptom and two arousal and cognition and mood symptoms.</p>



<h3><strong>TREATMENT</strong></h3>



<p>The treatment include:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Medication-</strong> SSRI antidepressants are the only FDA approved medications for people with PTSD. The response rate of patients to this medication is rarely more than 60 percent and less than 20 to 30 percent achieve full remission of their symptoms. Researchers do not support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of PTSD. Antipsychotic medication risperidone might benefit individuals.</li><li>Psychological Perspective- People with PTSD have a high level of neuroticism, negativity etc. so their coping and personality styles are very important. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is considered one of the most effective therapy. It combines some type of exposure with relaxation and cognitive restructuring. Other alternative methods include interpersonal therapy, mantra repetition and acceptance and commitment therapy.</li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) the clinicians ask the client to think about a traumatic event while focusing rapid movement of the clinician’s finger for 10 to 12 eye movements. Though being used to an increasing degree, EMDR lacks the effectiveness associated with some type of exposure therapy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Positive Psychology proposes that people can grow through the experience of trauma. With this approach, trauma potentially allows clients to find the positive interpretation of their experiences.</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Things happen in life which can change everything but we should not lead that happen. We should always move on in life because it is an important thing. Learning about your own symptoms is very important. There is always someone who can help you so seek help from people. Accepting and healing does not mean forge eying but it helps to build confidence that we come up with bad memories.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">A<strong>nxiety Disorder</strong> is the experience of chronic or intense feelings of anxiety that is feeling about something that might happen to them in future. People face difficulties functioning on a daily basis. They also experience fear about the things that might happen to them. They try their best to avoid situations that provoke their emotional responses. So, they face problems in social situations like public gatherings or in their jobs etc. They have a lifetime prevalence of 28.8 percent and overall 12-month prevalence of 18.1 percent. Of all cases, 23 percent are considered as severe. People between the age group 30 to 44 reports lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders. Women are 60 percent more likely than men to experience anxiety disorders.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Separation Anxiety Disorder </strong>is experienced by children when they have intense anxiety concerning separation from their home or caregivers. It is natural for a young child to feel anxious when they are separated from their parents. It usually starts from a child’s first birthday and can last up to their fourth birthday. Parents can ease their child&#8217;s anxiety by being patient and by setting some limits. However, some kid’s anxiety does not go away and it becomes a sign of a larger problem that is separation anxiety disorder. It is not a normal stage of development. Children with this disorder avoid situations in which they will be parted from their caregivers. Even the thought of separation causes extreme anxiety. Situations like when their caregivers are going to work or before going to sleep at night they become anxious. They ask one of their parents to stay with them and leave them after they sleep because they get nightmares regarding separation. Adults avoid going out and staying with others for example going to a friend’s house for a night out.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">When they are separated from their caregivers they develop intense fear. They think something terrible will happen to their caregivers or themselves. The fear gets intense that they feel they will get kidnapped.&nbsp; To avoid this situation they complain about physical symptoms such as stomach ache, fever etc. They become panicky, miserable, homesick, socially withdrawn and sad. They also demand constant attention and sometimes become so clingy that they will not allow one of their caregiver to go out of sight. People with separation anxiety disorder are also at greater risk of subsequently developing other anxiety disorder such as panic disorder.</p>



<p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p>



<p>The symptoms of separation anxiety disorder include:</p>



<ol><li>Fear and worry that something will happen to their caregivers</li><li>Children refuse to go to school</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Complains about headache and stomachache</li><li>Clinging to the caregiver</li><li>Nightmares about separation</li><li>Fear of being alone</li><li>Bedwetting</li><li>Temper tantrums</li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Children and adolescents should show at least three symptoms from the above mentioned symptoms. The symptoms should last for at least four weeks and cause significant distress.</p>



<h3><strong>CAUSES</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It occurs because of the fear a child has in some ways. If we can know the actual cause we will be one step closer to help the child through their struggles. A strong genetic component was used as evidenced by analyses based on twin data. Important environmental factors such as low-income environment, new house or school can trigger symptoms. They can also develop it because of natural or manmade disasters such as losing a loved one in an attack or tsunami etc. An overprotective parent or insecure attachment can also be a problem because they manifest their own anxiety about separation on the kid.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Separation Anxiety Disorder is diagnosed on the basis of the signs and symptoms shown by the person. It varies from age to age. Children in the range of 5 to 8 show more symptoms than the 9 to 12 age group. Young children report more nightmares. Adolescents are more likely to report physical symptoms. Parents and child symptoms differ from each other. Clinicians are more likely to diagnose children with the disorder when parents report their symptoms. There are no laboratory tests for this disorder but the clinicians can ask for a blood test. If no physical illness is found, the child is sent to a psychologist to diagnose and treat them.</p>



<h3><strong>TREATMENT</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The majority of children diagnosed with the disorder are completely free of symptoms within 18 months. However, people those who need help get the proper treatment from the clinicians. Behavioural techniques such as <strong>Systematic Desensitization</strong>,<strong> Exposure Therapy </strong>and <strong>Modeling</strong> is used for treating fear and anxieties. <strong>Contingency management </strong>and <strong>self management</strong> are also useful in teaching child to react positively to their fear-provoking situations. The therapies can be given individually or in combination. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy seems to be the most promising. It helps to reshape the child’s thinking and behaviour. Other therapies include Talk Therapy and Family Counseling to help the child to fight from their fears of separation. &nbsp;There are no specific medications but in severe cases, antidepressant or anti-anxiety pills can be given to the person. Parents can also help their children at home by making proper plans for them and replacing their anxiety provoking thoughts into positive thoughts and also by setting some limits. They should also allow the child to stay or go to some place alone and should give up on their insecurities regarding their children.</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Most children with the disorder get better and healthy with time. They need family support and love and when this thing combines with the treatment the chances of recovery improves. There is no way of preventing it but acting and recognizing it at the right time is important. They should live at a better place and should adapt with the changes and should give away their fears and accept the challenges with a positive attitude.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Eating Disorder happens when a person experiences continuous disturbances of eating or eating related behaviours that cause changes in the consumption of food. This disorder has major effects on a person’s physical and psychological functioning. The person experience lack of control over their impulses. Other difficulties include faced by individuals is control over their eating, dieting or elimination of food.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder in which a person is unable to maintain normal weight and have an intense fear of gaining weight and have distorted body image. Three basic symptoms shown by the person involves restricted eating, unrealistic fear of getting fat and disturbed self-perception of body shape. The person has abnormally low body weight. They feel that they are overweight even though they are seriously underweight. The depletion of nutrients that occur because of anorexia leads to a lot of health changes some of them can be life-threatening. Starting from the brain, they cannot think right, there are changes in their brain chemistry and they have bad and fainting memory. Their hair gets thin and brittle. Have low blood pressure and slow heart rate and can also face heart failure. They also face anaemia and other blood problems like low potassium, magnesium and sodium in the blood. Weak and swollen joints and more prone to fractures. May face kidney stones and kidney failure. Constipation and bloating, menstruation stop, bone loss and women face problems in getting pregnant and there are higher risks of miscarriage. Skin gets bruises easily and gets dry. Hair all over the body, skin gets pale and nails get brittle.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are two types of anorexia, the <strong>“restricting</strong>” type involves that they get engage in restricting calories. The other is <strong>“Purging”</strong> type in which they lose weight by vomiting. People who have anorexia experience a core disturbance in their body image. In one study it was shown that women suffering from anorexia showed distinct arousal patterns in area of the brain involve in processing emotions. Women with the restricted form appears not to value thinness so much as they are repelled by the idea of being overweight. The lifetime prevalence in women is 0.9 percent and 0.3 in men. The majority of individuals who develop it are in their early 20’s. Men have 25 per cent lower lifetime prevalence than women.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Many people get confused between Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa which is another type of eating disorder. In Bulimia, a person engages in binge eating during which they eat an excessive amount of food during a short period. In order to avoid weight gaining, they involve in purging which causes different physical and psychological issues.</p>



<h3><strong>CAUSES</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The exact cause of anorexia is unknown. The conditions may run in families. From a biological point of view, the researchers are interested in the role of dopamine which plays a role in the feeling of pleasure including those which are related to eating. The abnormal processing of emotions in people may be related to other genes that are related to depressive mood. There are environmental or social factors such as constantly comparing their bodies to others and never getting satisfied with one own self and hormonal changes. The messages from social media and the fashion industry that thin is beautiful. Other factors are physical or sexual abuse or being bullied.</p>



<h3><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>There are two types of symptoms Physical and Psychological.</strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <strong>Psychological Symptoms</strong> are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Refusing to eat</li><li>Not eating in front of others</li><li>Feeling sad and anxious</li><li>Low self-esteem</li><li>Lying about eating</li><li>Fixation on body image</li><li>Denying that they are underweight</li><li>Using diet pills and purging</li><li>Lack of emotions</li><li>Reduce sex drive</li><li>Memory loss</li><li>Changes in sleeping patterns</li><li>Trouble in relationships</li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <strong>Physical Symptoms</strong> are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Dizziness</li><li>Loss and thinning of hair</li><li>Constipation</li><li>Dehydration</li><li>Pale and dry skin</li><li>Feeling cold all the time</li><li>Tremendous weight loss</li><li>Loss of periods in women</li><li>Loss of muscle mass</li><li>Low blood pressure and heart rate</li><li>Swollen hands and legs</li><li>Brittle nails</li><li>Bad breath and tooth decay</li><li>Over-exercising</li></ol>



<h3><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Early diagnosis and proper treatment help the person to fight this disorder. They should show the following symptoms for the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa. The physicians detect signs of anorexia they should also test for diabetes, chronic infections, malabsorption, cancer etc. and blood test and image scans. People with anorexia also have mood disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and social phobia.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA’s)&nbsp;<em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5)</em>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/anorexia-nervosa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnostic criteria</a>&nbsp;for anorexia nervosa are as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.</li><li>Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.</li><li>Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.</li></ol>



<h3><strong>TREATMENT</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The primary aim of treatment involves identifying and changing the individual’s maladaptive assumptions that occur regarding their body shape and weight.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</strong>, clinicians attempt to change what are selective biases people regarding eating disorder that lead them to focus on the parts of bodies they dislike. By using <strong>Exposure Therapy</strong> in which clients view their bodies in the mirror in an attempt to reduce negative emotions that they experience. They teach them mindfulness techniques to reduce negative cognitions and affect their bodies by giving them psychoeducation about the ways that their beliefs reinforce their negative body image. In the sociocultural perspective, clinicians use family components for clients. Parents take the whole charge of their eating and weight. It can also involve family therapy and nutrition counselling to help the client to regain healthy eating habits.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There is no specific medication for this disorder. They can be given medication to control anxiety, depression and OCD. SSRIs such serotonin and olanzapine can be given when their weight is 95 percent of normal of their height and age. Hospitalization may also be needed if there is severe weight loss and the client refuses to eat.</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">May researchers believed that it not a disorder which cannot be treated. &nbsp;The person can live a normal and healthy life by not being judgmental of other people and being kind and respectful. They should meet people who can help them and should take treatment from professionals. They should have high self-esteem and should believe that they are getting better day by day.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Personality Disorder is an ingrained pattern of relating to other people, situation, events with rigid and maladaptive patters of inner experience and behaviour. In DSM-5 it represents a different set of behaviour which is categorized under different categories. The type of behaviours that this disorder represents involve excessive dependency, fear regarding intimacy, intense worry, uncontrollable range etc.  There are three clusters which come under this disorder that are as follows, Cluster A includes Paranoid, Schizoid and Schizotypal personality disorder which share features involving odd and eccentric behaviour. Cluster B involves antisocial, borderline, histrionic and Narcissistic Personality Disorder which share overdramatic, emotional and unpredictable attitudes and behaviours. Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent and obsessive compulsive personality disorders, which share anxious and fearful behaviours.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Narcissistic Personality Disorder is primarily characterized by an unrealistic, inflated sense of self-importance and a lack of sensitivity to the needs of other people. It comes under Cluster B personality disorder. The term comes from a character in Greek mythology called <strong>Narcissus. </strong>He saw his reflection in the water and fell in love with it.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It should not be confused with high self- confidence and self- esteem. High self-esteem people are humble while people with NPD are likely to be selfish; they boss over people and ignore other feelings and needs. They may have high self-esteem but they are insecure. They think of themselves as better than others. Some individuals have grandiose self which is referred by clinicians as Grandiose Narcissism. They rely on other people to confirm their worth. They are more sensitive to rejections, feel a sense of shame. They are shy and not empathic. When they feel that they have not lived up to their standards they withdraw themselves socially. They derive themselves from the way that they believe other people view them.&nbsp; In their personal relationships, they cannot develop true closeness with their partners because they are so focused on themselves that they ignore other person feelings and needs.&nbsp; They are unhappy with their life in general and take it n a negative way. They are unable to see the damaging effects their behavior is causing to themselves and others.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to studies, NPD may occur in approximately 1 per cent of the population. The ratios are higher in the population of individuals seeking clinical treatments with those estimates ranging from 2 to as high as 36 percent.</p>
