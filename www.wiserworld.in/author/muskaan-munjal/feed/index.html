										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">North Korea has always been a controversial/disputable topic to discuss. Now, why is there a North Korea and South Korea and not just KOREA? Korea was one single country but it got divided after the second world war. The Soviet Union occupied the North of the country and the USA occupied the South of the country. It was formally divided into North Korea and South Korea on 9<sup>th</sup> September 1948. Both the countries are not only separated geographically but they both are 2 different worlds, like chalk and cheese.</p>



<h3><strong>Living Conditions in North Korea</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">North Korea is a military dictatorship and doesn’t provide enough food for its people. It is considered to be one of the world’s most isolated and poorest country. North Korea&#8217;sPresident Kim Jong-un is one of the ruthless dictators and he keeps tight control over the economy. It is mostly unable to meet the needs of its people. North Korea&#8217;s economy suffered a devastating downturn in the 1990s when it shrank by nearly a third, and starvation is considered to take the lives of nearly thousands of people. Things have improved but still aren’t great in the country. Since 1948, North Korea has been ruled by the men from the same family. The 25 million people living in the country live under a form of communist rule. Its very difficult to leave the country and people hardly get to visit North Korea. People can’t listen to foreign broadcasts or even watch foreign movies there and whoever does faces harsh punishments. This also means that people there have no idea of outside/world events and they also don’t know what their country is thought of by the outside world. Most North Koreans are extremely poor and can’t even afford things like washing machines, fridges etc. People who try to change the system of the country or try to question the leadership are brutally punished and sometimes killed. North Koreans can’t demand things from their government. Kim Jong-un forces people to cheer for him and people do that because they think that they would get into serious trouble if they didn’t. From the early years, people of North Koreans are taught that their leaders are powerful gods and that they are supposed to worship their leaders. People there don’t have access to the internet. It is available in the country but it is only accessible to the government officials.</p>



<h3><strong>Rumours Surrounding Kim Jong Un</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The state government has claimed many things to their people about Kim which are completely fallacious. Kim once stated that he has supernatural bodily functions i.e. he doesn’t urinate or defecate or go to the washroom for any such actions. So far, we have established that North Korea has one of the worst international reputations, but people there are told that their leaders and the country itself are beloved around the world and every country remembers and celebrates their birthdays. The state media has also claimed that Kim started to drive by the age of 3 though, to be honest, what is the need, really. It is also said that younger Kim is a celebrated musical composer and is very famous around the world, which he is but obviously not for the music.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Relations between North Korea and the United States</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/692331-kim-trump-north-korea-flags-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="NORTH KOREA - A DICTATORSHIP WITH NUKES" class="wp-image-2650" width="591" height="332" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/692331-kim-trump-north-korea-flags-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/692331-kim-trump-north-korea-flags-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/692331-kim-trump-north-korea-flags-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/692331-kim-trump-north-korea-flags-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /><figcaption><em>Kim Jong Un meeting Donald Trump in Singapore</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">North Korea has active nuclear weapons and can possess biological and chemical weapons capabilities. The country has shown illicit behaviour by withdrawing from nuclear weapons treaties. In <a href="https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/">2017</a>, North Korea successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile and also conducted thermonuclear weapon test in September 2017. Later, it was discovered that its nuclear activities were more extensive than declared. North Korea posed to be one of the most persistent U.S. foreign policy challenges (Post-Cold War period). Having made advances in nuclear and missile weapons under Kim Jong-un, North Korea has evolved to be a grave security threat to the United States. The United States and North Korea began denuclearization talks in 2018, but those negotiations have been frozen since February 2019. Meanwhile, North Korea simultaneously has continued to develop its nuclear powers. If a power struggle in the family after Kim’s death, implications emerge for U.S. interests, including questions about control of the country’s nuclear arsenal, the potential for a humanitarian crisis, and the possibility of a confrontation with China that could alter the fundamental security of the country.</p>



<h3><strong>Power within Family</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In April 2020, his disappearance from public view prompted reports that he was gravely ill or had died following heart surgery. The 36-year-old dictator, with obesity and a heavy smoker, is reported to have suffered from various health problems. Kim is believed to have three children under the age of 10 but has no obvious heir. If he dies or becomes incapacitated, it is undetermined who would be the next ruler. His younger sister and his confidante, Kim Yo Jong, is among the most likely to take control. She played a prominent role in summit diplomacy, but analysts wonder if a woman could become the leader.</p>



<h3><strong>Covid-19 in North Korea</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Leader&nbsp;Kim Jong Un&nbsp;warned top party officials of the &#8220;serious consequences&#8221; of failing to prevent an outbreak of the new&nbsp;coronavirus&nbsp;in the country. The poverty struck nation, which has a weak and ill-equipped healthcare system, has closed its borders to prevent the spread of the disease into its territory.<br>Pyongyang, capital of the country has not reported a single case of COVID-19, which has killed and infected citizens of dozens of countries since it emerged in the neighboring country, China. Moreover, there are debates over the survival of North Korea if the pandemic reaches its citizens. Poverty struck, starved with no medical facilities and little to no education, many believe that more than half of the 25 million people living there will die or incapacitated to work or uphold their families leading more to starve and die. The military bans on executing every patient of the virus without thinking of the consequences. Other countries, like South Korea and USA plan on providing medical services to the country.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">To sum it up, the living conditions in North Korea are horrible. People are not given any kinds of basic human rights such as freedom of speech and expression. There are no medical services provided and if Covid-19 reaches the country’s borders then a large sum of people will fall to their demise. It is one of the only 9 countries who have nuclear weapons and its cold relations with countries surrounding it and the US, it is a threat to not only itself but the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Ever since the coronavirus showed up, the urge between people to be outdoors is understandable. Traveling or even going out for work/school/college has been put on hold. People can’t even see a doctor unless it is very urgent. <strong>The worst casualty of this pandemic is the loss of human contact/ bans on mass gatherings</strong>. We all know that engaging in any sort of celebrations such as weddings, functions, concerts, etc. can be too risky. Coronavirus has also caused a hug and handshake hiatus. <strong>The world shut down for COVID-19</strong>. It all comes down to some undetermined questions- Will we able to shake hands with other people without any hesitation? Will we ever be able to celebrate the occasions without any fear of coronavirus in our head? Will skin-to-skin contact ever be considered normal again? Will LIFE ever go back to normal again? And many more….</p>



<h3><strong>How the virus has affected the education system</strong>?</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">About <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/coronavirus/2020/05/06/Life-after-coronavirus-Five-things-that-may-never-go-back-to-normal">72%</a> of the world’s student population has been affected because of the closure of schools, universities, institutes, etc. because of the virus. Many universities and schools decided to cancel their exams and promote the students to the next grade/semester. This has many disadvantages too. Students who have been promoted without taking any exams will suffer because of this in the future. They will have to complete the pending course in the next semester/grade, which will lead to stress/anxiety and time management would be very difficult. And students who are completing their pending syllabus through online classes are having trouble in concentrating. How much can a student learn when there is- Buffering in the internet, poor connection, voice not audible, chaotic classes and many more factors that can interrupt the learning in online classes.</p>



<h3><strong>Educational Institutions</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">When we talk about the future, there will be an enormous number of young people who will be unemployed. People are already working from home and we do not know how long that is going to work. So many companies, factories shut down because of the pandemic. Teenagers or youngsters who are in school or college will have problems finding jobs after they graduate. There is a very high possibility that corona is here for a long time. Students might have to complete their education through online classes. If schools/colleges do open up, they will have to have a very systematic way to protect students from Corona. They will have to do check-ups on a regular basis and whatnot. And this will probably be going to cost so much to the institutions.</p>



<h3><strong>Hygiene Habits</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Wearing facemasks outdoors, washing hands for 20 seconds, maintaining social distancing, sanitizing hands regularly might be with us long after the virus diminishes. We may never go back to casual hugs, handshakes, etc.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The tradition of wearing face masks in Japan is a common custom predating COVID-19 and can be traced back to the flu pandemic of 1919. Ever since the Spanish flu outbreak, wearing a mask was the first thing that was prescribed to avoid the flu, but the tradition of wearing them continued until the end of the pandemic, albeit not to the same degree as today.</p>



<h3><strong>Food Supplies</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Factories around the world shut down for a while so the supply got short. Then the US stopped exporting meat, but the factories kept making more. And now the US has a lot of meat. But factories, where there were Corona patients, shut down and pigs after a certain age can’t be made into meat. So, now they will all go to waste. Then all export-import from China has stopped in all countries, not only to boycott China but because everyone feels that China is responsible for this ongoing Pandemic. Also, COVID-19 is a rich man’s disease so farmers don’t get it. Due to this, there is no stoppage of wheat. But as areas get locked down, the food doesn’t reach everyone. People who are traveling on foot i.e. Migrant Workers can’t get anything to eat for days because all shops are closed. Food supplies for farmers may not vary so much but for restaurants and hotels, it means a great deal. People are selling their shops and stuff just to have money to survive and big companies are making use of this. They are buying as many areas as they can. As these restaurants’ owners get bankrupt, the big companies are getting richer off of them.</p>



<h3><strong>Vaccines</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">What we know about the virus is maybe not everything. Knowing everything about is going to take some time. Even if we have vaccines, it will take several more months to produce as well as to distribute and administer sufficient supplies, and longer if more than one dose is required. Also, it could be months before treatments are available that can treat the virus. Currently, Russia is experimenting on a vaccine against the coronavirus, it hasn’t published any results for it yet but it has begun the next stage of testing. Once again, vaccines will take some time to be available. As of now, there is a new level of consciousness between people and it will be there with us for a long period of time. </p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For now, we have to work with the environment we have right now. There might be no going back to the pre-corona world. As they say, Radical acceptance is the path to change. All we can do for now is take as many precautions as we can. It is not just the government’s responsibility but that of the citizens also. We will have to pull this off in a very subtle manner. We are not even near the end; we are just starting.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">This pandemic may give rise to all the introverts and cleanliness freak who like to wear gloves and sanitize their hands-on regular basis. And this will help us for a better future. Many people will take up these habits to protect themselves from the virus. And this behavior will help us to prevent any upcoming pandemic/epidemic in the future. This might be the starting of a complete online phase. All innovations will be done from home and garages. All transactions, relationships, etc. will be online. The biggest threat is capitalism where one company will hold all reserves and capital and new or small businesses will have a difficult time growing. But we think about it, we have alternate futures waiting for us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">India is the largest manufacturer of drugs worldwide. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/pharmaceutical-india.aspx" target="_blank">IBEF</a>,<strong> the Indian pharmaceutical sector supplies over 50% of global demand for various vaccines.</strong> The government has taken some initiatives to promote the pharmaceutical sector in India. Government hopes, for example, to create a nearly Rs 1 lakh crore fund to boost companies&#8217; domestic output of pharmaceutical ingredients by 2023. Also, the same website says that Medicine spending in India is expected to rise by 9-12 percent over the next five years, contributing to India being one of the top 10 medicine spending countries in the world.</p>



<h3>Challenging Factors</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While the sector continues to grow, there are some <a href="https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/article/103336/the-potential-of-the-indian-pharmaceutical-industry/">factors </a>that may challenge its growth in the near future. Lack of stable pricing, drugs in India is not affordable for some people. 60% of the population in India does not have regular access to essential medicines just because they are pricey. Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) and National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) work hand in hand to review the prices that are carried out on such products. Currently, the DPCO regulates 74 bulk medications. The second factor is the lack of technological capabilities. So maybe improving the innovation space would help with pharmaceutical growth.</p>



<h3>Jan Aushadhi</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Indian Government’s Department of Pharmaceuticals has also initiated operations for a people’s medicines shop, called <strong>‘Jan Aushadhi’</strong>, in various locations. These shops sell generic medicines at much cheaper rates than the price of corresponding branded medicines.</p>



<h3>Vaccines</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Vaccines are another prominent area of growth</strong>. India is one of the largest vaccine producers in the world, with many new vaccines set to be launched in the next 5 years. India currently exports vaccines to about 150 countries. PWC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/pharma-life-sciences/pdf/global-pharma-looks-to-india-final.pdf">says </a>that it meets around 40-70% of the World Health Organization&#8217;s demand for the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis or whooping cough, and tetanus).</p>



<h3>OTC and Ayurvedic Medicines</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Indian consumers also put greater focus on prevention and well-being, which should lead to continued growth in the sales of OTC vitamins and mineral products. The demand is already starkly rising. Artificial sweeteners, emergency contraceptive pills and nutritional supplements are some profitable OTC drugs. &nbsp;Some of the leading OTC brands in India are registered as ‘Ayurvedic Medicines&#8217; because of their plant-based natural active ingredients. There are no price controls on ‘Ayurvedic Medicines’.</p>



<h3>Joint Clinic Trials for Ayurveda</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India and the US intend to launch joint clinical trials against the novel coronavirus for formulations of Ayurveda. The two countries partnered to support Ayurveda through a joint program of research, teaching and training. Via collaborative activities the Indo-US Science Development Forum has also been instrumental in fostering excellence in science, technology and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Ministry of AYUSH</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">AYUSH stands for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy. The Ministry of Ayush focuses on developing education, research, and propagation of alternative indigenous medicine systems in India. It has faced strong criticism of funding schemes. Clinical quality was poor, and medicines were implemented without any clinical trials and studies. Concerns have been raised about AYUSH based healthcare.</p>



<h3>Future Prospects</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The future of the pharmaceutical sector in India would be good because-increase in the burden of diseases, rising income of individuals, improvement in healthcare infrastructure and many more things. The sector is already growing so much because of the leading coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<h3>Pharma and Coronavirus</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The impact of the pandemic and the lockdown triggered a visible effect in financial markets.<strong> Drugs that are Made in India are supplied to developed countries such as the US, EU and Japan. </strong>These drugs are known for their well-being and standards. People are going crazy over a bottle of Sanitizer. Hospitals are full. Pharmacies are always crowded. If we talk about the future, we don’t know what is ahead of us. Corona is probably here for a long time. We can’t say that no other disease will hit India in the future, so, pharmaceutical sector is expected to grow multifold and continue to be an attractive investment destination.</p>



<h3>Economic Boost</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India’s population is increasing day by day, as its economy, so demand is likely to increase for the drugs. Income levels of households will rise very steadily. Government coming with ‘Below Poverty Line’ (BPL) segment will also be profitable for the pharma sector. Also, the acceptability of modern medicine and newer therapies will increase due to aggressive market creation by players.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India&#8217;s pharmaceuticals industry has risen in faith and firmly moved onto an accelerated growth course. The main issue now lies around the real culture and the full scope of this market &#8216;s ability. Backed by strong fundamentals, the market is giving rise to a range of business opportunities.</p>

How you think, how you feel, your constant mood swings, your sudden change in behaviour- it all comes under <mark><mark>mental health</mark></mark>.</p>



<h3><strong>Symptoms</strong></h3>



<p>Conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, lucid dreams, phobia, insomnia affect our mental health. Overthinking plays a very huge part when we talk about mental health. Many people tend to think too much about the situations which will probably never happen. People don’t have control over how much they overthink. There are many solutions to overthinking if you search it up on the internet but, in reality, it’s not very elementary. You can experience these conditions at any point of your life, no matter the age, sex or ethnicity. Some people can be more prone to depression than others because of well, life situations, peer pressure, sexual identity and whatnot. </p>



<p>According to a study by WHO, half of all mental health conditions start by <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health">14 years of age</a>. Adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of support from their parents/friends. As per the same study by WHO, suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents because of mental illness and lack of access to help/therapy. There is a growing consensus that healthy development during childhood contributes to good mental health.</p>



<h3>Lancet’s Study</h3>



<p>Lancet has found the efficacy of “brief lay counsellor delivered, problem-solving intervention’’ for mental health problems in adolescents from government schools in Delhi. This is for adolescents who can’t afford to pay for therapy sessions. The premium for Adolescents (PRIDE) is a six-year research programme dedicated to making psychosocial interventions for improving the mental health of adolescents in India. “The study established that with limited resources and counselling intervention, we can give practical tools to adolescents to manage and deal with their mental health issues. This also makes mental health treatment accessible to those from underprivileged sections of society,” says Dr Kanika Malik, a clinical psychologist. The programme is going really well and is pretty successful. More than 250 adolescents were enrolled for the programme between August and December in 2018. For the treatment, they made a problem-solving booklet in a comic format to keep up with the interest of the adolescents. The book has many chapters which teach the kids to deal with domestic problems. This is very important because domestic life can be a major source of stress for the students and they don’t have the resources to tackle these situations but the comic book gives them tools to work through them. Not only did they distribute the booklets but also hired and trained the members of the community to counsel students. </p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/lancet-study-on-mental-health-of-adolescents-in-delhi-6484827/"> study by the lancet</a>, more than 99% of adolescents and children with mental health problems remain undiagnosed in India. If these students receive proper treatment right now, they are less likely to suffer from serious mental health conditions in the later stage of their life.&nbsp;The initiative that lancet took for these adolescents is exceptional.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vulnerable Teens&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Another problem that <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/psychological-disorder-girl-with-borderline-personality-disorder/">students</a> face while growing up is whether or not they should tell their parents about what they are going through. Adolescence is a very crucial period in our lives. Your decision-making power is not the best at this age. Parents are also requested to listen to their kids, to understand them, to tell them that it’s normal to feel this way. Many kids have abusive parents which makes it even more difficult for them to go through the illness.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Look out for yourself and other people</h3>



<p>&nbsp;Mental illness is a very serious condition and it should not be neglected. Your brain is just as important as your heart and other body parts. It can only handle so much. Also, we should not forget the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic right now and this COVID situation is not helping. This is for all the parents, if your kid is struggling, love him/her. This is for all the people who have friends with mental illness, support your friends.</p>
