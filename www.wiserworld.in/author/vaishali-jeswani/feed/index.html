										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">On 17<sup>th</sup> July 2019, The International Court of Justice <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/court">(ICJ)</a> pronounced its verdict in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. With a ratio of 15:1, the judgement was pronounced in India’s favour. The court asserted that Pakistan has breached the Vienna convention signed in 1963, by denying the right of consular access to India.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav">Kulbhushan Jadhav</a> is a retired navy officer of India. He was arrested by Pakistan on 3<sup>rd</sup> March 2016 on the suspicion that he was a spy sent by India. India received the news on 25<sup>th</sup> March which was after a delay of 22 days. India asserted that Jadhav who was carrying on a business in Iran after retirement was abducted and falsely charged on the grounds of ‘terrorism and espionage’. In April 2017, The military court of Pakistan awarded the death sentence to Jadhav. After this judgement by the Pakistan court, India approached ICJ asking for consular access to Jadhav and challenging the sentence by the Pakistan court.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Senior Advocate Harish Salve was the lead <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kulbhushan-Jadhav-case">counsel</a> in the case from India at the Heage based ICJ. In July last year when the ICJ pronounced its judgement, it asked Pakistan to ‘review and reconsider’ its decision on death sentence and allow India access to Kulbhushan without any delay. However, in an online meeting this year Harish salve from London said that India needs to decide as to whether it wants to go back to ICJ for consequential remedies as Pakistan has failed to comply with the judgement. To this Pakistan Spokesperson, Aisha Farooqi replied that Pakistan has complied with the judgement and is firm on continuing to do so as the case proceeds further, she also stated that they have granted consular access and are reviewing the death sentence.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>WHAT IS THE KULBHUSHAN CASE?</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="334" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jadhav-111-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2674" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jadhav-111-1.jpg 600w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jadhav-111-1-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><em>Kulbhushan Jadhav</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Kulbhushan Jadhav is an Indian retired navy officer who is on death row in Pakistan. His father is a retired Mumbai police officer, his family resides in Mumbai and includes his two children and wife. He is charged on grounds of sabotage and espionage activities against Pakistan at the command of Indian Intelligence agency. India refuses to accept the allegations.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Pakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested by Pakistan officials in Balochistan on 3<sup>rd</sup> March 2016, where he entered using a fake passport which showed his name as Hussain Mubarak Patel. While India maintains that he was abducted from Iran, where he was carrying on business after he was retired from the Indian navy. India got the news about his detention on 25<sup>th</sup> March, which was after 22 days from detention. After a month of his arrest, a video was released by Pakistan in which Jadhav was shown confessing that he’s a spy from India and had been carrying out activities in Balochistan and Karachi, still working with the Indian navy. The video was condemned by India.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">When Pakistan denied consular access to Jadhav under article 36 of the Vienna Convention and its military court sentenced him to death, India approached ICJ against Pakistan&#8217;s judgement and requested the release of Jadhav. On 17<sup>th</sup> July 2019, the ICJ allowed consular access to Jadhav but denied his release. It ordered Pakistan to reconsider the death sentence. Consular access was allowed by Pakistan and Indian officer met Jadhav in Pakistan on 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2019.</p>



<h3><strong>SALIENT FEATURES OF THE JUDGEMENT</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">ICJ pronounced the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/168">judgement</a> in India’s favour with a ratio of 15:1. Some of the salient features of the Judgement are:</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Admissibility</strong>&#8211; The court denied Pakistan&#8217;s objection on the admissibility of the matter, based on Article I of the Vienna convention whereby compulsory settlement of disputes to the Vienna Convention on consular access of 24<sup>th</sup> April 1963 is provided. The court in a ratio of 15:1 said that the claim of non-admissibility by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is not valid and India can access the court.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Breach of obligation by Pakistan</strong>&#8211; The court said that Pakistan has breached its obligation incumbent upon it by Article 36 paragraph 1(b). It did not inform Kulbhushan about his right under article 36 and thereby deprived India of its right to consular access to the Individual Concerned.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Deprived India of its Right</strong>&#8211; By not allowing India to have communication with Jadhav and denying access, Pakistan deprived India of its right to meet Jadhav and arrange Legal Representative for him and thereby breached Article 36, paragraph 1 (a) and (c) of Vienna Convention on Consular Access.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Pakistan under Obligation to inform Jadhav without any delay about his right under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Review and Reconsideration</strong>&#8211; The court observes that Pakistan needs to review its decision, through its choosing, to ensure that weight is given to the violation under article 36 while taking into consideration article 139, 145 and 146 of the Vienna convention.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Essential stay</strong>&#8211; The court said that the stay on execution is essential for the effective review and reconsideration by Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>DEVELOPMENTS AFTER JUDGEMENT</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Indian counsel in the Kulbhushan case on 3<sup>rd</sup> may 2020 said that they are hoping to persuade Pakistan to release Jadhav from the backchannel on humanitarian grounds or whatever they want to call it, we want them to let him go. Salve commented that India might consider going back to ICJ due to non-compliance of the order by Pakistan; However, Pakistan on Sunday denied the allegations made by salve and said they are baseless and inaccurate. Pakistan&#8217;s spokesperson said that it is &#8216;regrettable&#8217; that salve made statements which misrepresent facts adding that Pakistan has complied with all international obligations.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Pakistan on 14<sup>th</sup> may say that it is taking necessary steps to review the case as per the directions of ICJ and has already granted consular access to India.&nbsp; On 16th of July, Pakistan allowed India consular access to Jadhav, which as per the officials was neither meaningful nor credible. On 7th August, Pakistan court constituted a three-member bench in response to the petition filed by the government to appoint a representative for the death row prisoner. The decision came after the Islamabad high court passed the directions to set up a larger bench to hear the dispute. The next hearing on the case is scheduled on 3rd September. The developments come after an argument between the foreign spokesperson of Pakistan and India, while the former claimed that India has been communicated through diplomatic means to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav the latter denied receiving any such communication. A spokesperson from the ministry of external affairs said that Pakistan is not only<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-pakistan-court-constitutes-larger-three-member-bench-to-hear-petition/article32300367.ece"> violating</a> ICJ’s judgement but its own ordinance too.</p>



<h3><strong>CRITICAL ANALYSIS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>`</strong>India and Pakistan share this long history. Amidst this, when an Indian retired officer was arrested by Pakistan on charges of espionage chaos took place. While Pakistan says that Jadhav is a spy, India maintains its stand that he was abducted by them from Iran where he was carrying business activities post-retirement. When the Pakistan court sentenced Jadhav to the death penalty, India decided to approach ICJ. India argued at ICJ that it had been denied consular access and was notified about the arrest 3 weeks later, it also put forth the request that kulbhushan is released by Pakistan. While ICJ directed Pakistan to review its decision it denied India&#8217;s request to order the release of kulbhushan. ICJ acknowledged the fact that Pakistan violated the International norms of consular access and did not inform Jadhav about his rights; Conviction and detention of Jadhav are not violative of Article 36 of Vienna convention as per ICJ. Appeals and Review petitions are not allowed on ICJ verdicts. After the verdict, Pakistan has assured that it will comply with ICJ’s judgement. On 2<sup>nd</sup> September Pakistan allowed consular access to India and an Indian diplomat met Jadhav at the Pakistan jail for an hour, the entire proceeding was recorded in the presence of Pakistan officials; India contended that Jadhav seemed to be under immense pressure. India is demanding independent access to Jadhav because the capital punishment was awarded to him in a secret trial therefore, any information from Jadhav can help India.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Vienna Convention was signed to regulate diplomatic relations. A consular access treaty was also signed in the year 1963. The treaties were formed under the auspices of the United Nations. Once India is granted Independent access, it can arrange the best legal service for Jadhav allowed under Pakistan laws. Since the Pulwama attack tensions have been there between the two countries. After India struck down Article 370, new tensions have developed. Pakistan by holding a free and fair trial can ease the tensions. If a civil court conducts the trial help can be provided but if the military court continues to govern the case little can be done. If Pakistan denies following ICJ&#8217;s verdict, India might severe diplomatic relations and use International pressure, but all these measures must be used cautiously to maintain peace.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The ICJ has given its verdict, Both countries have assured to follow the judgement. While Pakistan granted consular access to India, it was not entirely free from control. From the statements delivered by Harish salve, it seems that India might approach ICJ once again to remind Pakistan about the judgement. In reply to statements given by Advocate Salve, Pakistan&#8217;s spokesperson said that the statements are false and misrepresent the facts, and assured that Pakistan is following up with the verdict and will continue to abide by further pronouncements as the case proceeds. India&#8217;s co-operation would be required to ensure justice, thus both countries need to mutually co-operate to conclude.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Historically, India shares economic ties with the Arabian peninsula, especially with the gulf regions alongside its eastern shores. The maritime trade route between the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2016/06/revealed-the-truth-behind-the-indus-valley-civilizations-collapse/">Indus valley civilization</a> and civilization of <a href="http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/198002/the.sumerian.connection.htm">Dilmun</a>, located on the island of Bahrain and adjacent to the shore of Saudi Arabia was the first such route to be recorded in the history of the world. Dilmun had acquired a trade monopoly between the civilization of Mesopotamia and the Indian subcontinent by 2000 BCE. Historical facts and records <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brotherhood-Kings-International-Relations-Ancient/dp/0199858683">demonstrate </a>that traders from Dilmun stayed in south Asia and vice versa for extended periods. Those goods which were largely missing in the middle east like spices and cotton were acquired by merchants from Dilmun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, the trade between Arabian peninsula and India was dominated by Arab traders from Oman and yamen. At the same time, Indian ocean trade between East Africa, middle east and India were dominated by Oman. Trade between Arabia and India became the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5n359Tp2FRMC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=Richard,+Edmund.+India%2527s+pro-Arab+policy:+a+study+in+continuity.+Greenwood+Publishing+Group,+1992.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qA-9JJp6u5&amp;sig=oMeN_xCx0hg1brTc12x2CUJ7om0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6hvHanY_NAhVIziYKHeViC0oQ6AEIITAB%23v=onepage&amp;q=Richard%252C%2520Edmund.%2520India%2527s%2520pro-Arab%2520policy%253A%2520a%2520study%2520in%2520continuity.%2520Greenwood%2520Publishing%2520Group%252C%25201992.&amp;f=false">backbone</a> of Arabian peninsula by the end of the first millennium CE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, Arabia had less to export to India and most of the goods flowed from India to Arabia. Expect, the <a href="http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199005/servants.of.the.pearl.htm">pearl industry</a> which was an important export until the discovery of oil in the Gulf region. In places like Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Dubai, pearl diving was a way of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relations between India and the Gulf region became stronger during the British raj when in addition to an economic component a military component was acquired by them. British had begun to dominate the subcontinent, by the mid 19th century, the control and influence exercised by them on Arab territory came as a result of their need to protect the sea lanes. The British conquered Aden in 1839, which was administered as a province of British India. A protectorate was established by the British in Abu Dhabi in the year 1820 and later on over Dubai, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and other states that would later form the United Arab States (UAE). The British affairs of Arab were managed by British officials in India and were garrisoned on British command by Indian soldiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The relationship between India and the Gulf region began to change and reverse with the independence of India and the discovery of oil in the Gulf region. The balance of trade began to shift as a result of exporting oil. Today, 80% of oil is exported in India from the region and independent India failed to te the gulf economically as British India did. Despite the economic turn faced by India, it continued to maintain important relations with the region relative to others. By the 21st century, India’s export to the gulf region were more than the European Union. I.e. In the financial year 2012-13, India’s export to GCC stood at $51 billion according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/">financial times</a>. About 15% of exports in India go to the Gulf. India was also the largest trading partner of Dubai until china <a href="https://gulfnews.com/business/china-overtakes-india-as-dubais-largest-trade-partner-1.1478108">overtook</a> it in 2013. The strong relation between the two is maintained even today.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>INDIAN IMMIGRANTS AND THE GULF</strong></h3>



<p>India is the top recipient of remittances alongside being the largest country of international migrants. Since the ‘oil boom’ from the 1970s, Indian migrants to the gulf became a valuable source of income and backbone of economies for high-migration states through remittance transfer. During this period, the migrants have largely contributed to the economic development of the gulf region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, In recent years’ condemnation of treatment provided to domestic expatriate workers and blue-collar in the region has cast the migration in a less favourable light, demanding greater attention from the government of India to worker welfare and diaspora issues. Regardless of this, complaints of abuse, hardship and exploitation persist.<br>The return of workers has increased and the outflow of migrants has slackened due to fluctuation in the oil market, economical slowdown and changing gulf policies. The <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> pandemic too clouds the future of gulf-India migration relations, which would be a <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/india-gulf-migration-testing-time">challenge</a> for the government of India as well as the workers and their families dependent on them due to healthcare and livelihood challenges that they would have to face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The usual return to jobs after the travel ban ends is far from assured. Return of labours and New jobs depend upon the economic capacity of the gulf. Indian migrants who would return to gulf would be required to present their medical certificates as per the mandate of Kuwait authorities. However, once the pandemic ends, Gulf states could impel sweeping wide-ranging departures. A more likely scenario is an adjustment of reliance on foreign workers followed by a cut in government contracting and levying of high employer and visa fees. Either would give a blow to the economy of India as well as to the families and communities of people who have long served the gulf states as a lifeline.</p>



<h3><strong>KUWAIT EXPAT QUOTA&nbsp; BILL</strong></h3>



<p>Among the large number of migrant workers that India sends to the world, a total of 9 million Indian migrants are employed in the Gulf region. USD 82 billion in form of remittance were received by India during 2019 as per world bank report. Due to the pandemic, many workers are left in a vulnerable condition as the countries of destination are failing to provide new economic opportunities because of which the migrant workers are returning to India. Kuwait’s total population stands at 4.3 million, out of which 3 million are migrant labours among which over a million belong to India. As a result of the rising pressure over the economies, Kuwait became the first among the GCC countries to introduce a bill aiming to deport migrant workers from the country. During the first week of July, Kuwait decides to roll out a bill to reduce the number of foreigners in the country as proposed by the PM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;According to the new ex-pat quota bill <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eight-lakh-indians-may-be-forced-to-leave-kuwait-as-the-country-approves-expat-quota-bill/article32000615.ece%23:~:text=According%2520to%2520the%2520bill%252C%2520Indians,reported%252C%2520citing%2520a%2520Kuwaiti%2520newspaper.">approved </a>by the Kuwait authorities on reducing the number of foreign labourers in the Gulf region, eight lakh Indians can be forced to leave their jobs and return to India. The legal and legislative committee of the national assembly has determined that the bill is constitutional. The bill allows a maximum of 15% Indians in the region, while the Indian community consists of 1.45 million of its population making it the largest ex-pat community in Gulf. Due to the pandemic and a slump in oil prices, government and the lawmakers call for a reduction in the number of ex-pat community in the country. Kuwait remains the largest source of remittances for India, the country received nearly $4.8 billion from Kuwait as remittances in the year 2018. Most of the COVID positive cases in Kuwait come from foreigners as the disease spreads between the migrants living in overcrowded housing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>IMPACTS OF THE NEW BILL</strong></h3>



<p>Some important facts on both sides- India and Kuwait need to be considered at this point. Now that the Kuwait government is planning on sending back foreign workforce, the authorities would need to perform a rain-check and see if the local population have the requisite skills and knowledge to perform the jobs. These semi-skilled work involves low pay and therefore attracts migrant workforce, the<a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/columns/article/indian-migrant-workers-in-kuwait-challenges-and-opportunities-for-india/626515"> willingness</a> of the local community to take up the jobs would impact the market of Kuwait.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the Indian government has launched SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) to record data relating to skills of migrant workers returning to India, which can be used by recruiters to appoint and use workers in India. However, the current market is already suffering from the pandemic and a considerable number of people have lost their jobs, in such situation it won’t be easy to reintegrate these returnee workers in the domestic market. Many of the labourers are returning without getting paid what was due to them which would be another roadblock in the reintegration efforts. These workers would join the people who have returned through Vande Bharat mission and are looking for jobs in the country. Return migrants should be included in the employment and social development programs offered by central and state governments irrespective of where they come from. A number of these people might consider re-immigrating, for this, the Indian government must check the markets and deport migrants to that area where demand is high.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p>At this point, India needs to strengthen its ties concerning migrant labours with Kuwait and other GCC countries, where most of the Indian workforce resides. While maintaining bilateral ties is important, a roadmap needs to be prepared for the development of international migration policy for labours which would take into consideration both returnees and migrant workers from the country. In a regional meeting under the aegis of MEA (ministry of external affairs) organised by India together with Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the strengthening of bilateral relations during this times to protect migrants workers was deemed to be a priority, which was supported by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Marijuana is a mixture of the dried flowers belonging to Cannabis Sativa. It is popular by other terms like pot, herb, weed, mary jane, ganja and other slang words. Marijuana is smoked by people either in the form of a rolled-cigarette known as joints, in pipes, through bongs or rolled in cigar wraps (blunts). <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-marijuana">Marijuana</a> is mixed into food items like candies, brownies or cookies when sold or consumed for medical purposes apart from that it can be used to brew tea.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Charas, marijuana, bhang are derivatives of cannabis, which are popular in tradition and are used by adolescents. While some people get dependent on it others leave it after early experimentation. The drug has been legal for most of human history and illegal for 1% of the time since the time its been in use.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>MARIJUANA IN INDIA</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In India, Cannabis has been in use since 2000 BC. A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences in the year 2019 shows that cannabis has been consumed by 7.2 billion Indians in the past year. As per the 2016 drug report of UNODC, the retail price of cannabis was the lowest in the world at US$0.10 per gram. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 is the central law that deals with cannabis in India. Although, states have their laws regarding the sale, consumption or use of marijuana. In general, it is seen as a crime and can land someone in trouble. In India, Uttarakhand was the first state to allow the cultivation of Hemp for commercial purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Under the 1985 act, anyone found engaged in the practice trade or consumption of Cannabis or bud can be made liable for an imprisonment of up to 20 years. Even the possession of drugs attracts legal charges which depend upon the quantity in the possession and the purpose does not matter. The production of hemp and marijuana is also strictly banned in the country. However, the state governments have been vested with the power to grant cultivation license for some purposes (medical and research). Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the two northern Indian states have received the license to cultivate hemp.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Indian market for cannabis has received attention recently due to various NGOs and activists filing petitions to legalise it. The arguments often point towards the medical benefits which cannot be ignored and the boost that it can bring for the Indian economy with millions of jobs due to ideal climatic conditions required for cultivation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India shares a medicinal and mythical history with Marijuana. It&#8217;s been in the lives of people for centuries now. In 1986, Under the pressure of the medical lobby of the US, the country gave in and formed strict narcotic laws that prohibited the production, sale, consumption and transportation of drugs illegal. Since then, arguments in favour of legalising this drug and keeping it banned have been made. The ban did not bring much change, except for the fact that a legal source of government income has been shifted to international drug groups.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>COMPARISION WITH THE WORLD</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The cannabis was legalised for medical purposes by Germany in the year 2017, which left a remark on other EU members. The recent rise in interest and investment by the Uk and Europe in the medical cannabis market is the result of deregulation of cannabis for medical causes. Denmark, Poland, Portugal and the UK have changed their regulations related to medical cannabis. In November 2019, the NHS in England approved two cannabis-based medicines which were used to treat epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Uruguay, Canada and other<a href="https://thewire.in/health/cannabis-marijuana-india-legal"> 11 US states</a> legalised the export, import, possession, distribution of cannabis for research and medical purposes. Luxembourg, who legalised the market for medical purposes now intends to loosen their laws further to legalise its production and consumption, it would be the first European country to do so. Only four countries have accepted and allowed the medical and recreational use of cannabis which are Uruguay, Canada, Georgia and South Africa.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India might have taken its first step towards legalising Cannabis. The Delhi high court in 2019, served a notice to the centre challenging the prohibition on the plant snd demanding justification for criminalising it for industrial and medical purposes. Uttarakhand already came out in open when it allowed the cultivation of hemp in 1000 hectares of land in 2018, which can be sold to the government only. The court’s notice is the result of a PIL filed by the great legalization movement India trust (<a href="https://www.glm.org/">GLM</a>) which is a non-profit organisation working towards raising awareness about the medical, industrial, economical and other benefits of cannabis while making efforts to decriminalise it. The petition challenged certain provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, which banned the use of Cannabis. The medical benefits of the drug were pointed out and alleged that banning it violates Article 21 (Right to life) of the constitution.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Cultivation of the drug is illegal in India. However, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research received permission from the health ministry to cultivate the crop in j&amp;k in the year 2017 solely for medical purposes. while the industrial, medical and recreation use of the drug is illegal in India. It is receiving acceptance across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The cannabis market has been misunderstood in India for a larger part of it. The laws are outdated and require re-consideration. The increasing support for the market and the rising number of hemp and cannabis seems encouraging. The economic and medical benefits that India would derive from the market cannot be ignored, considering the circumstances of support received by the drug; it might not be long that the Indian government unlocks the potential to legalise the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Studies show that marijuana is less harmful than other drugs like cocaine, morphine, alcohol etc, and provide relaxation and comfort to the senses, unlike others which lead to aggression in most cases. The country has taken significant steps towards legalising marijuana for medical purposes and it might someday allow the industrial benefits to expand too. Moreover, its legalisation would stop illegal international drug groups to enter and harm the economy as before its criminalisation it used to be a source of income for the state. A check on the use can be maintained as prevention often makes a drug stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Telemedicine allows health care professionals. i.e. Doctors. To evaluate, diagnose and treat patients using <a href="https://chironhealth.com/telemedicine/what-is-telemedicine/">telecommunication technology.</a> It is a way to treat patients through a distance. During early days, the practice was used to connect doctors treating a patient at one place to specialists at another location; which proved to be useful for rural areas where specialists are rarely available. The equipment necessary for conducting remote visits remained complex and expensive, so while the use of approach was growing, it remained limited. The rise of internet age brought changes in the scenario. Availability of high-quality video transmission through smart devices opened up the opportunity of delivering remote healthcare as an alternative to a person to person visits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/telemedicine-is-new-normal-in-healthcare-lets-accept-it/articleshow/76185368.cms">Coronavirus outbreak</a> took place in India, the India council of medical research (ICMR) allowed doctors to take recourse to telemedicine. It is a modern healthcare practice around the globe. Telemedicine is provided by the doctors since 2000 in India but as the COVID-19 outburst took place it has received the necessary statutory support. The state medical councils revoked the ban on telemedicine which led to it being fully legal and beneficial for the patients and the doctors. The step became necessary despite the fact of whether the healthcare teams and patients were ready or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On 7th July 2020 <a href="https://twitter.com/NITIAayog/status/1280370920318595072">Niti Aayog</a> made a statement on twitter- A study shows that 50 million Indians have accessed online healthcare and in-person doctor visits are down by 67 per cent. What a feat!</p>



<h3><strong>BENEFITS OF TELEMEDICINE</strong></h3>



<p>Telemedicine gives the patients to make decisions and teaches them self-care. For example, in the case of diabetes patients visit doctors once in 2-3 months to get advice on change in the dosage of medicines. Such visits can be skipped. The patients can get in touch with a specialist of their choice located in another city through video calls or other mobile applications. We have various communication platforms like WhatsApp, mail etc., the time has come to adopt all these technologies. Some of the <a href="https://doxy.me/en/advantages-of-telemedicine/">benefits</a> are-</p>



<ul><li>Reduces healthcare Costs- It helps to reduce healthcare costs by avoiding transfer of patients from one location to another, reduction in hospital costs etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Improves quality health-care delivery- It can help improve the quality of delivery with both mental and physical conditions.&nbsp;</li><li>Enhances traditional face-to-face medicine- The practice of telemedicine should support the traditional practice rather than replacing it. The medical practitioners shall pay a visit to patients from time-to-time while still providing convenience and flexibility of seeing patients remotely.</li><li>Provides engagement and satisfaction- The practice makes it easy for patients to maintain their health while engaging in the practice of taking care of themselves.&nbsp;</li><li>Provides access to care- The time gap that travels brings between care providers and patients can create a hurdle in access to care. It can be beneficial for people in rural areas and locations with undermined facilities.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>DISADVANTAGES OF TELEMEDICINE</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Lack of Personal <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/telemedicine-benefits-and-advantages#:~:text=Disadvantages%2520of%2520Telemedicine&amp;text=One%2520of%2520the%2520main%2520disadvantages,costly%2520for%2520smaller%2520healthcare%2520facilities.">relationship</a>&#8211; If a patient prefers a face-to-face relationship with their doctor or a more intimate treatment, then telemedicine might not the option for them. The patient may never meet the doctor in person.</li><li>Availability and Cost- For health care providers, it can be difficult to set up and maintain the process. It can be very costly for small healthcare clinics.</li><li>Insurance- Not all countries allow <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/telemedicine-benefits">insurance coverage</a> for telemedicine. Currently, only 26 states require insurers to cover or reimburse the costs.</li><li>Protection of data- Hackers can access the medical information of a person, especially when the patient uses a public network.</li><li>Delay in Care- In case of requirement of emergency care, accessing telemedicine first may cause a delay in treatment because a doctor cannot provide life-saving tests or laboratories digitally.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3><strong>AVAILABILITY OF APPS FOR TELEMEDICINE CONSULTATION</strong></h3>



<p>These applications are <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/telemedicine-is-new-normal-in-healthcare-lets-accept-it/articleshow/76185368.cms">need of the hour</a> now, we must be careful while using them as we cannot avoid them completely. Nowadays most of the urban patients keep blood pressure machine, thermometers etc. with them, but when these apps are connected to the apps the information goes to the doctor directly which can help him advise the best treatment. Some apps have diagnostic centres attached to them, the information goes to the doctor and the patient is provided with the timely and best advice. Smart-phone parameters help to maintain a record of patients which helps in tracking the changing health parameters, it is an elaborate and trendy way to provide help to the patients.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE TO ACCEPT THIS CHANGE?</strong></h3>



<p>In the last few decades, people have adapted themselves to many technological changes. It is time that we learn to live with the novel coronavirus. The doctors have made themselves <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/telemedicine-is-new-normal-in-healthcare-lets-accept-it/articleshow/76185368.cms">ready for it</a>, now the patients need to get accustomed to this practice too; so that crowd, long queues at doctor’s clinic can be avoided. Hospitals will always be available for emergencies but consultation from home is the best option in current times. Primarily developed for providing assistance in rural areas, it has found a fresh lease of life during this pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fear is running high which is making it easy for people to get people on board with telemedicine. Based on a study of 5 crore people who accessed online healthcare between March and May by Health tech platform Practo shows how virtual appointments increased by 500% out of which 80% were first-timers, signalling a possible shift in healthcare delivery. The older people might find it difficult to accept these changes given the fact that they are not familiar with smartphones and the digital world.</p>

<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p>Despite being in existence for decades now, the telemedicine was not an active practice given the ambiguities around it. The uncertainty of rules and legislation that came along with it, made it a risky practice and patients, as well as the doctors, choose to stick to the forever-old practice of in-person treatments. However, pandemic changed the situation. From the past few months, given the amount of risk around the world people became ready to divert to remote healthcare practices. While it has its own pros and cons, the practice is the need of the hour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">On 1st July 1997, the United Kingdom ended their administration for Hong Kong and<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/reversion-to-Chinese-sovereignty-1020544#:~:text=At%2520midnight%2520on%2520June%252030,the%2520People's%2520Republic%2520of%2520China."> handed over the control</a> of the colony to china; popularly known as Handover of Hong Kong. It continued to govern and maintain an economic system separate from mainland China. Hong Kong was required to have a security law from the beginning but it didn’t because of its unpopularity. Now, China has stepped in and passed a wide-ranging <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-passes-national-security-law-for-hong-kong/article31950835.ece">security law for Hong Kong</a> to protect its authority from what it sees as a challenge to its authority. The new law will make it easy to take down protestors and reduce the autonomy of the state. Critics have called it “the end of Hong Kong”.</p>



<h3><strong>About the New Law</strong></h3>



<p>The new security law came into force on 30th June 2020. It contains 66 Articles that deal with subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with external forces. Although the law covers the aforementioned laws, their definitions can be interpreted broadly to cover various types of speech and forms of organizing. Life imprisonment can be awarded for calling on foreign governments or publishing views which are considered anti-Beijing. So, can be awarded for making statements undermining the ruling authority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53230391">key provisions</a> under the law are-</p>



<ol><li>To vandalize public property would be considered terrorism;</li><li>Breaking away from the country, colliding with foreign governments, using violence against persons or property, going against the central government is punishable with life imprisonment at maximum;</li><li>Beijing would establish a new security office in Hong Kong which won’t be under the local jurisdiction;</li><li>Those convicted under this law won’t be allowed to stand for public offices;</li><li>Companies can be fined if found guilty;</li><li>The new security office can transfer cases to mainland china for trials;</li><li>Neither the judicial offices nor the public bodies would have the authority to interpret the law, the power rests with Beijing authorities when the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law;</li><li>People can be wire-trapped and put in surveillance if authorities suspect them for breaking the law;</li><li>Trials can take place behind closed doors;</li><li>The law would also apply to outsiders</li></ol>



<h3><strong>A Threat to Hong Kong?</strong></h3>



<p>The people of Hong Kong are afraid of their freedom under the law. Beijing has said that people should protect their rights and liberties while safeguarding the nation’s authority. Reports show that the people have started deleting posts from the fear of being prosecuted under the new law. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China, but now it is feared that it won’t be independent anymore and would look like Mainland China.</p>



<p>On 1st July, Hong Kong completed 23 years of Handover by Britain to China. Usually observed by a long march, thousands of people gathered to protest and were arrested for crimes that did not exist a day before. Around 370 people were arrested, out of which 10 were arrested for the new law which protects Beijing from challenging political activities. The law threatens the cultural scene and civil liberty that exists in Hong Kong which makes it different from the rest of China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people from Hong Kong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html">wish to emigrate</a>, a task which was promised to be made easier by Britain. The British government informed that some Hong Kongers would be allowed to live in Britain for five years and then would be allowed to apply for citizenship. Not only the citizens but international organizations are also evaluating their future in the city because the new law said that the government would strengthen the management of foreign NGOs and news agencies. Many Activists have deleted their accounts from social media platforms like twitter and telegram fearing their past activities might lend them in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joshua Wong, who is perhaps the best-known activist, announced that he is quitting from his youth political group named Demosisto which was founded in the year 2016, citing concerns for his safety. After that, three other leading members left the group leading to an announcement of the disbanding of the group altogether. News agencies have been asked by authors to take down their posts. The central government assured that the law is to bring stability but chaos seems to be all around the place.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the Motive of China?</strong></h3>



<p>Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997 over a small agreement- a mini-constitution for Hong Kong called the basic law and a ‘one country, two systems’ principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms of Hong Kong which no other part of China has. Under Article 23 of the basic law, Hong Kong was supposed to enact a security law that did not happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Protests over an extradition law turned violent and resulted in an anti-China movement. China does not wish to have it again. The law punishes protestors to protect the authority.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>India’s Stand on the Law</strong></h3>



<p>Amid the ongoing tensions on borders with China, India on Wednesday made statements stating that it hoped that the relevant parties would address the concerns “properly, seriously and objectively” while not naming china. The statement was made by <a href="https://thewire.in/diplomacy/in-new-line-after-lac-clash-india-asks-china-to-address-hong-kong-security-law-concerns">India’s representative</a> at the ongoing UN human rights council in Geneva. India urged the security council to seriously address the matter of recent developments in Hong Kong, as it is home to substantial Indian Community.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Standing up for Hong Kong is in India’s interest both diplomatically and politically because as per sources Hong Kong is India’s top trading partner as opposed to China and India shares a history with Hong Kong since the early 19th century- be it, Indian soldiers, fighting for the city or entrepreneurs adding to the dynamics of their market.</p>



<p>China and India are currently amid a <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/ladakh-intrusion-swerving-from-an-uncaring-towards-a-dancing-dragon-yet-treacherous/">military stand-off </a>on borders in 45 years. India lost 20 soldiers last month, in a clash with the Chinese troops. India has remained silent over protests at Hong Kong over several years, so a statement by India is significant.</p>



<p>Last Friday, the UN independent experts in a joint statement asked the human rights council to hold a session to monitor abuses like “Moves against people of Hong Kong”.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The new law introduced by China to protect the government in power is being demonstrated as an end of Hong Kong by the critics. It increases Beijing’s power on the city-state threatening freedom of people residing in Hong Kong. Arrests under the new law have been made on grounds that did not exist until a few days ago, forcing citizens, multinational organizations, news forces etc to ponder over their future. Even if China claims the new law&#8217;s power to bring back stability, the current situation seems to be creating fear while dominating the rights the city enjoys.&nbsp;</p>
