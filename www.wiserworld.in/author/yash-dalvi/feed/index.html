										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">According to <strong>the World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>, around <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/767524/over-300-million-people-are-affected-by-depression.html"><strong>300 million</strong></a><strong> </strong>people all over the world have been affected due to depression.<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-74ede2e9-b178-474a-8ba1-d00fa4a8a2b8"></mark> It basically leads to sadness and can make an individual both mentally and physically weak. <mark>It is an illness and a medical disorder that affects the behaviour of a person which can be observed through behavioural changes.</mark> It can also affect the different systems of the body, mainly the immune system, and can disrupt their sleep pattern (insomnia) or can conduce early awakening in the morning or can be accompanied by anxiety.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In India, as reported by the <strong>National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16</strong>, nearly <strong>15%</strong> of Indian adults require interceding for mental health issues and at least one in twenty Indians suffer from depression. According to the recent WHO report India is the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/india-is-the-6th-most-depressed-country-who-report/articleshow/66179026.cms"><strong>6<sup>th</sup> most depressed</strong></a> country with 258,000 reported suicides in the year 2012. The report also mentions that around 80% of Indians don’t seek treatment after getting diagnosed with depression, mostly because of the stigmatization of mental health in Indian society.</p>



<h4><strong>Reasons for Depression:</strong></h4>



<ul><li> Hormonal changes in the brain of a human being.</li><li>A person who always thinks negatively or perceives the conditions with a pessimist approach more likely faces stress loneliness and anxiety.</li><li>Some people who constantly experience violence, hatred, abuse, poverty, and relationship disputes easily tend to fall in depression.</li><li>Sometimes genetics plays a major role in making a person vulnerable to depression as it runs from the parents to their children and affects them without external causes.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Symptoms of Depression:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Fluctuating body weight</li><li>Energy loss or fatigue</li><li>Feeling irritated or agitated</li><li>Finding oneself guilty and worthless</li><li>The feeling of being left out</li><li>Reduced concentration power</li><li>Lowering interest and pleasure in activities and works.</li><li>Suicidal thoughts or constant thoughts about self-harm</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Present Scenario</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Normally, people in the midst of lockdown have confined themselves in their houses which might be necessary for the amelioration of the nation but when it comes to the mental health of an individual, without any medical treatments or personal measures being taken many people are going through major repercussions like <strong>depression, anxiety, frustration, fear, etc</strong>. and these sort of feelings within a person has resulted in the upsurge of activities like <strong>domestic violence and suicide attempts</strong>. Usually, people tend to find solutions for such problems through an intense consumption of alcohol and drugs but improper awareness, the looming threat of a pandemic, fear of joblessness, and lack of medical facilities available in hospitals have caused amplification of this issue.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Confirming to the <strong>Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</strong>, India requires around <strong>13,000</strong> psychiatrists. An ideal ratio to be attained is <strong>1</strong> psychiatrist for<strong> 8000</strong> patients but at present, we have <strong>3500 </strong>psychiatrists which are about <strong>1</strong> for <strong>2 lakh or 200,000 </strong>people. Regarding clinical psychologists, we need <strong>20,000 </strong>but we have only <strong>1000</strong> working clinical <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/we-need-more-mental-health-care-professionals-in-india/articleshow/66146320.cms">psychologists</a>. Though we are doing much well in the manufacturing, supply, and export of PPE kits yet it’s a need of the hour to fill this gap between the patients and the doctors required for mental health treatments by the government.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Social media has become an alternative way of living a life for us where due to loneliness people have presumed social networking sites as a second world. We have already witnessed cases of suicides due to a lesser number of likes and public views on social media handles of a person. Current so-called modern communication tools have resulted in remoteness from personal/physical engagements and gatherings.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to lockdown, we have started utilizing video calling tools that are leading towards a virtual life rather than a real one. Though it must be helping us in the continuation of our regular schedules it has now led to such disorders and has started affecting humans both mentally as well as physically. A human is called a <strong>social being</strong> but soon this sentence will reverberate as a fantasy and unfortunately, in the end, these social beings will find themselves as introverts.</p>



<h3><strong>Medical Treatments and Therapies for Depression</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is one of the most lethal disorders, it can be treated which must be done as soon as the illness gets diagnosed. The general method for getting it treated is with <strong>medications</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/psychological-disorder-girl-with-borderline-personality-disorder/">psychotherapy </a></strong>or with the combination of both. When these solutions don’t work <strong>electroconvulsive therapy</strong> and <strong>brain stimulation therapies</strong> are the options that are mostly explored.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Considering the medications, <strong>anti-depressants</strong> are the most recommended medicines to treat depression which may improve the brain’s way of using certain chemicals that manages the mood and stress of an individual. They may usually take <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> to<s> </s>deliver some positive results. Such kinds of prescriptions should never be taken without the counsel of a trusted doctor because an over-dosage or mistakes in the courses of intake of an antidepressant can cause serious side effects.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is another option which is also termed as <strong>‘talk therapy’</strong> or <strong>‘counselling’</strong>. It can help to reduce the symptoms of depression. Methods such as <strong>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</strong>, <strong>cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving therapy</strong> are the approaches for the treatment of depression.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If the above mentioned medical treatments don’t give expected results then <strong>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong> plays a major role in the treatment of depression. The treatment includes continuous sessions which may be thrice a week for almost two to four weeks but may cause few side effects like confusion or memory loss. However, now due to the advancement in the method of ECT, it has become safer and more effective for the patients. The procedure though is not painful and a patient is put under anaesthesia. There are many more methods to treat this mental disorder which are being studied by the researchers and the doctors and soon may be utilized for the better and more accurate treatment of the illness.</p>



<h3><strong>Yoga to Overcome Depression</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Yoga alone should never be considered as a treatment for depression but should complement with proper medication and other options after proper consultation with the doctors. Regular yoga will definitely help a person to overcome stress and will give strength to think optimistically and makes a person optimistic. Yoga includes asanas, pranayamas, and also yoga philosophies.</p>



<h4><strong>Yoga Asanas</strong>:</h4>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<ul><li>Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)</li><li>Janu Shirsasana (One-Legged Forward Bend)</li><li>Setu Bhadasana (Bridge Pose)</li><li>Matsyasana (Fish Pose)</li><li>Pashchimottanasana (Two Legged Forward Bend)</li><li>Hastapadasana (Standing Forward Bend)</li><li>Marjariasana (Cat Scratch)</li><li>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog)</li><li>Sirsasana (Headstand)</li><li>Shavasana (Corpse Pose)</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These asanas help in releasing the tension and negativity from the systems of the body.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

</div>



<h4><strong>Pranayamas to relieve anxiety:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Kapal Bhati Pranayama</li><li>Nadi Shodha Pranayama</li><li>Bhastrika Pranayama</li><li>Bhramari Pranayama</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These pranayamas are done by focusing or putting attention on the breath to relax and free the mind and erase thoughts that procreates anxiety or depression.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Meditation</strong> is the method that should be followed daily because when a person gets too anxious regarding a threat or for varied reasons the muscles of a body get tense and the body starts sweating and scientific research has proven that meditation can significantly reduce the level of stress hormones.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The ancient <strong>yoga philosophies</strong> mention about two important principles of yoga, <strong>‘yamas’</strong> and <strong>‘niyamas’</strong>. According to this principle, niyama teaches about the value of containment whereas the <strong>Aprigraha</strong> principle guides us in overcoming greediness which has always remained a reason for anxiety. Another principle called the <strong>Shahucha</strong> principle glorifies the cleanliness of the body and mind. These principles also mention healthy eating habits and a proper lifestyle for a perfect livelihood.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Lastly, praying to the god and keeping positive group of company around ourselves can keep our faces smiling and can breed peace and joy in our lives.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The recent <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/actor-sushant-singh-rajput-commits-suicide-11592125887418.html">committing of suicide</a> by a well-known actor <strong>Sushant Singh Rajput</strong> has left us astonished and where <strong>depression</strong> is said to be the reason for the unfortunate step he took. These problems can simply get solved by sharing our feelings with the near and the dear ones and consulting trained professionals in due time. Unfortunately, the lockdown has kept few people away from their close relatives and friends even then suicide should never be a choice because <strong>“suicide does not end the probabilities of life getting worse but it eliminates the possibilities of it ever getting any better.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Leader’s of both the countries have recently attended a bilateral summit through a&nbsp;virtual medium and has resulted in the&nbsp;strengthening of relations betwixt India-Australia.</p>



<h3>Relations In The Past </h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The beginning of ties between both the countries emerged in 1788 itself when there was a European Settlement in Australia which led to a track on to and fro of goods in New South Wales by British East India Company through Kolkata. In 1941, the Indian Trade Office was established in Sydney. But later on, during the cold war era, Australia decided to back Britain and USA led alliance whereas India opted for a Non-Alignment. This had brought numerous misapprehensions between the relations of both countries. Canberra supported the British claim over Andaman and Nicobar Region. Later on, India rejected Australia’s attempt to mediate between India and Pakistan amid the 1940s and 1950s as Australia was in a close liaison with Pakistan, being a part of US alliance bloc.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In the midst of 1998, India had practised its nuclear tests, which was strongly condemned by Australia, yet later on the 2008 waiver granted to India by the NSG and subsequently lifting of uranium ban against the non-signatories of NPT along with a bilateral civil nuclear agreement had brought a solution over the hard relations.</p>



<h3>Australia’s Disparities&nbsp;With China</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Australia’s exports&nbsp;to China is over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-15/china-economy-slowdown-will-affect-australia/10716240">30.6%</a>&nbsp;worth&nbsp;123.3 billion&nbsp;yet a recent comment by&nbsp;the Australian government has mentioned that they don’t trade their values.&nbsp;CPCs interference in the internal affairs of Australia such as Chinese students protesting for its homeland agenda on Hong Kong and the South China Sea, furthermore practising activities like bribing politicians for promoting their own interest in the country has made Australia rethink over its relations with Beijing. Apart from this, recently the Australian government had insisted for a transparent and independent investigation into the covid19 pandemic which is mostly claimed to be originated in the wet markets of Wuhan. The retaliation by Beijing was by hitting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/why-has-china-slapped-tariffs-on-australian-barley-and-what-can-australia-do-about-it">heavy tariffs</a>&nbsp;on barley imports&nbsp;which were over 80.5% and have ordered it’s tourists willing to visit Australia to cancel their tour as Chinese are facing racist treatment on the foreign land.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Australia’s <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/widening-g7-are-democracies-allying-together/">close ties</a> with the USA&nbsp;have made the relations fragile as Australia shares its major security alliance with Washington and during the cold war era had been a part of US-led alliance since then has been sharing a warm correlation with the USA. Recently, the mouthpiece of the Chinese government,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190718.shtml">GLOBAL TIMES</a>&nbsp;had apprised Canberra of its closer ties with the USA captioning&nbsp;“ <strong>Morrison’s blind obedience to the US is a question mark on Australia’s independence and sovereignty</strong>”.</p>



<h3>India-Australia, Beginning Of A New Partnership</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">World’s first virtual bilateral summit was held between PM Modi and PM Morrison&nbsp;on 4th&nbsp;of June 2020, after the cancellation of meetings twice before, due to uncertain reasons like forest fires in Australia and a current pandemic. In the held summit both the nations have extended their affinity, later on mentioning it with a term&nbsp;“<a href="https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/32729/Joint+Statement+on+a+Comprehensive+Strategic+Partnership+between+Republic+of+India+and+Australia">comprehensive strategic partnership</a>”, whereas both the countries have signed&nbsp;nine agreements&nbsp;including&nbsp;<strong>Maritime Security in the Indo-Pacific,&nbsp;Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA)&nbsp;and&nbsp;MOU</strong> <strong>on cooperation in the field of mining and processing of Critical and Strategic Minerals.</strong> India has already signed a logistics pact with USA, Singapore, France and South Korea. This will reinforce India’s operational reach in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Both the countries have decided to conduct 2+2 dialogue to the level of defence and foreign&nbsp;ministers from both the sides who will meet and discuss on “<strong>strategic issues</strong>”. The meeting&nbsp;shall be held at least every two years. Both the countries have a shared vision of&nbsp;<strong>free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region</strong>&nbsp;that is&nbsp;rule-based&nbsp;and each and every country shall have&nbsp;<strong>freedom of navigation</strong>&nbsp;by adhering to the international laws of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.policyforum.net/freedom-of-navigation-and-the-law-of-the-sea/">UNCLOS</a>&nbsp;(<strong>United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea</strong>). The pair have agreed on peaceful resolution of disputes rather than coercive and unilateral actions.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Neither of the leaders had a discussion on China rather both of them have shown a positive viewpoint by coming together for a rule-based ecosystem in the region. Amidst India-China standoff the relations between New Delhi and Beijing have seen a new low. Most of the South East Asian countries have started speaking against the dragon and this has brought the middle powers to unite against the countries seeking hegemony. China’s attempts to seek unilateral&nbsp;authority over the South China Sea and its eye over the Indian Ocean&nbsp;has brought smaller and neighbouring nations to raise their concerns against the issue as well as the policy of&nbsp;<strong>debt trapping</strong>&nbsp;that China has been practising, have made the countries alert for their future relations with the so-called middle kingdom.</p>



<h3>Defence Cooperation Between India and Australia</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/first-ever-naval-exercise-between-india-australia-concludes.jpg" alt="India-Australia" class="wp-image-1749" width="445" height="334" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/first-ever-naval-exercise-between-india-australia-concludes.jpg 640w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/first-ever-naval-exercise-between-india-australia-concludes-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /><figcaption>Three Royal Australian Navy vessels and a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C made the passage to India for the inaugural biennial exercise.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The new partners are expected to collaborate in the upcoming regional groupings as well as in the naval and military exercises. Bilateral maritime exercise&nbsp;<strong>AUSINDEX</strong>&nbsp;was first held in Bay Of Bengal in 2019, while in 2018 Indian Air Force had participated in the exercise named “<strong>Pitch Black”</strong> in Australia. <strong>Kakadu</strong>, a biennial naval exercise held in Australia where 27 nations&nbsp;had participated in which India’s&nbsp;<strong>INS Sahyadri</strong>&nbsp;had represented Indian Navy in 2018. <strong>AUSTRAHIND</strong>&nbsp;which is an army exercise between both the countries was held in September 2019. India is expecting to invite Australia in the&nbsp;<strong>Malabar</strong>&nbsp;exercise in which&nbsp;<strong>US-INDIA- JAPAN</strong>&nbsp;are already participating, certainly, if Australia joins would become an exclusive exercise participated by the Quad members that shall magnify&nbsp;its&nbsp;strategic importance in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>



<h3>Diaspora</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The citizenry of Indians in Australia which increases up to&nbsp;<strong>7,00,000</strong>&nbsp;and the diaspora present on the foreign land is highly skilled. Most of them either have migrated for working purpose or to study in well known Australian universities. Around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/foreign-relations.htm">90,000 students</a>&nbsp;study in the universities of Australia. There are hardly any reports in the track records of students breaking the laws and violating the disciplinary rules in the country vis a vis Chinese students. As there is a growing population in the country Australian Indian’s celebrate Indian festivals which unite both the countries culturally.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The recent bilateral meet has definitely intensified the India-Australia relations and brought both the counties closer, sharing common interests and opportunities in the coming future. Concerning the economic domain, Australia is well versed with techniques and technologies lik<strong>e&nbsp;battery storage, Hydro pumping storage, techniques in agricultural post-harvest storage and logistics, Water conservation and management techniques etc</strong>. where India can focus and put its hands in. New Delhi is the 5th&nbsp;largest trade partner of Australia with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/foreign-relations.htm">$29 billion</a>&nbsp;trade of goods and services should see a rise in the succeeding years. Australian investors and manufacturers will have to take more interests in the Indian markets shifting their dependence on the Chinese&nbsp;that has always tried to manipulate the strings as per it’s own exigencies.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We have enjoyed watching both the countries playing as rivals to each other on cricket grounds but now this new collaboration between both the continents will lead to considerable results in the future against authoritarian actions and establishing values of&nbsp;<strong>democracy and liberty</strong>&nbsp;in the region.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">During a recent telephone conversation between US President Trump and Indian PM Narendra Modi, POTUS expressed a desire to expand the ambit of the G7 and hence have invited India along with other countries to be a part of the grouping in the next G7 summit, to be held in the USA.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The G7 or ‘Group of Seven’&nbsp;was authentically&nbsp;a ‘Group of Six’ initially&nbsp;in 1975, which included France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany but later in 1976, Canada became a part of the grouping resulting to the formation of G7. Eventually in 1998 Russia joined in the gathering and was called G8&nbsp;but post-Crimea’s annexation, the democratic&nbsp;alliance excluded Moscow from the group. It is a grouping of the most industrialized countries all over the world and after UNSC(United Nations Security Council) is the second most important gathering for discussing global issues regarding security, economy, and energy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As soon as the recent call was taken by POTUS, have created a dilemma that whether G7 is transforming itself by involving developing and middle-income countries together? Along with India POTUS has also invited Australia, South Korea, and astonishingly Russia again analyzing&nbsp;its strategic importance in the changing world order&nbsp;with an intention of keeping it far from Beijing. Considering the importance of India which has its global contributions in sectors like renewable energy, pharmaceutical medicines, steel manufacturing, etc. and its presence in the Indian Ocean has boosted up its strategic relevance in the region as well as over the world. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Is there something else that India holds more value that has brought it in the cynosure? Yes, it is the huge market that it holds and the intentions of the Indian government to invite massive foreign investments have brought a massive opportunity for foreign investors and manufacturing companies. The $3 trillion economy is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-became-third-largest-economy-in-2011-world-bank/article5963702.ece">3rd&nbsp;largest economy</a>&nbsp;when calculated on (PPP) basis and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/india-gdp-economy-growth-uk-france/">5th&nbsp;largest economy</a>&nbsp;when ranked by nominal GDP. The country is the&nbsp;<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-economy-may-grow-7-6-in-fy20-un-report/articleshow/67659157.cms">fastest growing</a>&nbsp;economy in the world. Ignoring India and other such growing economies have made POTUS rethink the current G7 structure which makes it outdated.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While Russia has accepted the invitation by the US president along with a condition of equal participation and yet has whispered the ignorance of China in the important group which is expanding, despite Beijing previously had been a part of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8+5">G8+5</a>. China being the second-largest economy and its growing ambitions over the world with respect to its BRI project makes the few, feel optimistic but it’s for sure that Washington is glaring at it with a threat over its hegemony. Re-arrangement of the 1976 grouping is being seen as a result of the expanding Chinese ambitions, its non-transparent behaviour amid a pandemic and it’s naval dominance in the maritime regions.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though this new bloc being created should not set its agenda as Anti-Chinese but bring back Beijing under the global, institutional-based world order i.e to make China realize the value of discipline-based existence without exploiting the smaller nations to fulfil&nbsp;“CHINA DREAM”&nbsp;or&nbsp;“CPEC”&nbsp;passing from POK and recent activities of<a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/ladakh-intrusion-swerving-from-an-uncaring-towards-a-dancing-dragon-yet-treacherous/"> intrusion in Ladakh</a> despite New Delhi being holding a claim over the disputed region. Beijing is ought to get over its old strategy of &nbsp;“DEBT TRAPPING”&nbsp;against small and economically weaker nations.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The current pandemic has definitely brought a new opportunity for each and every country to get back on track and revitalize their circumstances being faced since the past. As regards USA which is moving ahead towards its presidential election in the month of November is uncertain about the re-election of Mr Trump, but no one can forget the unilateral decisions that POTUS has taken every moment keeping ahead the slogan&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search">AMERICA FIRST</a>”&nbsp;or promoting protectionism against globalization is quite similar to Xi administration policies depicting&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/special/chinesedream/">CHINA FIRST</a>&#8220;. The USA will have to rethink over its past decisions and should progress ahead with multilateral dialogues. US administration should consider its allies before taking universally bothered decisions instead of facilitating it unilaterally. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Experiencing from the past actions of the USA like moving out from&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/">Climate Change&nbsp;Mitigation Agreement</a>”&nbsp;or&nbsp;&#8220;Withdrawal from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/">JCPOA</a>&#8221;&nbsp;would make other countries to think twice before getting allied and these points should be given thought upon by the POTUS with a further expectation demanding global support against China’s unilateralism.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If the vision of new G10 or G11(Indonesia may be invited in the new formation of G7) becomes a reality then it would look like an altered version of G20 yet with great importance. The next summit would be a second time that India under the leadership of PM Modi would show its presence. Last year French President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/emmanuel-macron-invites-pm-modi-to-attend-g7-summit-in-france-2051154">Emanuel Macron</a>&nbsp;had invited PM Modi to the summit. Prior to this PM Manmohan Singh had represented India in five successive G8 summits. Primarily, seat at the&nbsp;‘high table’&nbsp;for India would be a great platform to keep its foreign policy and security concerned interests as well as for its backing to confirm a permanent seat in UNSC along with a global consensus for its inclusion in the nuclear club. India’s dominance in the Indian Ocean would also get a global agreement to promote free trade in the region. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The affirmed mouthpiece of Chinese government&nbsp;‘Global Times’&nbsp;have lately warned India to refrain from getting into a proposed invitation in the G7 summit claiming it to be a&nbsp;“small circle that perceives China as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190654.shtml">imaginary enemy</a>”.&nbsp;Unlike a ping pong ball, being hitten from both the sides, New Delhi should take a pragmatic decision before allying with any of the bodies or nations. It should keep its neighbouring policies under consideration, as we see the ongoing tussle between India and China near LAC may have an undesired repercussions post-pro-G7 resolution, though firm decisions are always welcomed keeping India’s interest ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size"><strong>Racism</strong> is the old virus that has never ever left India but has transformed as per the time and still has not pulled out of our society since imperial India. Racism was just a concept introduced to prove domination of colonialists over the one to be ruled upon. Because they were answerable to their own mother country and with an aim to rule over the colony state, it was necessary to differentiate between the Caucasians (European physical type) and Indians.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Britishers were the introducers of physical differences amongst Indians for their own interests. They came to India with a motive of not only draining away the wealth but also to colonize the country and rule over the state. India was culturally diversified yet with backwardness and conservative thoughts possessed amongst the people. Such kind of orthodoxical beliefs could have been constructed&nbsp;through social reforms. And that’s why it wasn’t enough for the&nbsp;colonialists to gain control over Indians unless they were divided on the basis of physical division which is a permanent characteristic of a human that will remain until he dies.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Slaves prior to <strong>British colonialism</strong> were never sold on the basis of race but later on, it became a foremost criterion for their sale. The approbation of a caucasian aesthetic became a new standard for all and it continues till the recent times post-independence where plastic surgery, skin lightening, fairness treatments etc. have emerged with a huge demand amongst the Indians. The leaders like <strong>Sardar Vallabhai Patel </strong>who always had a motive to unite India and was successful in his ideas but still somewhere we see the differences amongst the people in the society on the basis of race which represents the last symbol of division that the British left here before leaving.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Today a fair person is considered to have a good looking face whereas a person with a dark complexion is said&nbsp;or rather mocked by racist slur “<strong>Kala</strong>”. Creams and cosmetic products have created a huge industry just because people have become obsessed with their darkness being questioned in society. Our brothers and sisters from South India have to face these discriminatory comments regularly like&nbsp;“<strong>Tamilian</strong>”&nbsp;for someone who is black or reiterating the accent of southern languages in front of somebody who is dark-faced. There are weird concepts&nbsp;spoken openly in the society that “drinking tea would make you black in colour”.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These social stigmas have ruined the minds of the common citizens and have made them weak mentally as well as physically because such kind of people always carries an inferiority complex within them reducing their confidence. In India, most of the African and Nigerians are looked with a feeling of uncertainty of being involved in drug peddling or other heinous crimes which is not correct.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Every community has few individuals who are a threat to the society but maligning every person of that community just because they appear similar leads to racism. Activities of this kind have no boundary limits which is evident with the recent killing of a 46 years old person named&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/blackouttuesday-a-social-media-movement-how-did-go-for-a-toss/">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;in Minneapolis, USA, who was an African American choked by a police officer after kneeling on the victim&#8217;s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds despite the victim pleading for his life. This violence was protested by a huge crowd all over the world, which has shown the revolution people seek to attain in this 21st&nbsp;century.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While in India, words and slangs like “<strong>Chini</strong>”, “<strong>Chinky</strong>”, “<strong>Momo Seller</strong>”, “<strong>Chowmein</strong>” etc. have&nbsp;become common for those especially belonging from North-East India. More than<a href="https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2019/02/the-racist-indians/">&nbsp;60 % of Indians</a>&nbsp;have experienced racist reactions and most of them are from the North-East. Recently amid a pandemic, a Mongoloid looking girl from Manipur was&nbsp;“<strong>spat on”</strong>&nbsp;and was called “<strong>Corona</strong>” by a&nbsp;middle-aged man. Similarly, on March 16, a man named&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cancer-patient-not-allowed-to-enter-society/story-6a0tzkUoIBjWAk65t9CpIK.html">Rinzin Dorjee</a>&nbsp;along with his daughter was not allowed to enter a Mulund society in Mumbai as inhabitants thought they&nbsp;both were “<strong>Chinese</strong>”.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GC-Northeast-Racism-1024x536.jpg" alt="racism" class="wp-image-1737" width="791" height="414" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GC-Northeast-Racism-1024x536.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GC-Northeast-Racism-300x157.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GC-Northeast-Racism-768x402.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GC-Northeast-Racism.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /><figcaption>Soruce: The Better India </figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to a New Delhi based organization, <strong>Rights And Risks Analysis Wing</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/east-and-northeast/coronavirus-outbreak-has-increased-racial-attacks-on-people-from-the-northeast-ngo-report-817899.html">RRAG</a>),&nbsp;there is a huge upsurge in the activities of racial discrimination against the people of North East, which went to about 22 cases between February 7 and March 25. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>North-East locals</strong> move to metropolitan cities for employment or students who migrate for their higher studies have to go through such tortures and harassments. There are many civil societies now who have come ahead in the protection of such North Eastern residents which has brought an effective plunge in the number of cases.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Lack of stringent laws:&nbsp;As the women are more vulnerable to the attacks though men are too facing this discriminatory behaviour but lack of stringent laws have made even police officers unaware about what sections the complaints to be filed under. No such law has been made which criminalizes racism or punishes the culprit for the same act. In case of a victim being a woman, police invoke section 354 of the IPC(Indian Penal Code) and Sec. 509 but what should be done if there is a male victim still remains a question to be answered by the lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Notwithstanding, derogatory words like “<strong>chinky</strong>&nbsp;“ or “<strong>corona</strong>” being abusive racially yet such&nbsp;words are not mentioned in SC and ST (Prevention of atrocities act) whereas few Mongoloids and not every community are a part of listed Schedule Tribes and hence this puts the police officer under a dilemma while attending such complaints.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Few Factors Responsible for <strong>Racial Discrimination</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Preconception:</strong>&nbsp;Usually a few people have a negative thought towards some other group or a religion or a community or an ethnic group. These preconceived thoughts lead to an act of discrimination towards some other person or a group.</li><li><strong>Ascendency:</strong>&nbsp;Racism basically is an act of oppressing the minority group and few people in the verge of creating their dominance try to oppress others belonging to a lower hierarchy. This proves their superiority in society and gives them pleasure of power.</li><li><strong>Lack of Cultural Sensitivity:</strong>&nbsp;People unaware and far away from their cultural roots would not have a feeling of brotherhood for another person belonging either to the same or a different civilization. Let’s say for example a terrorist who does not have any concern with respect to the culture of another group or an individual would always oppress and attack.</li><li><strong>Discrimination:</strong>&nbsp;Favoring and showing biased actions towards one&#8217;s own group, leads to racial discrimination in society.</li><li><strong>Impulse:</strong>&nbsp;People usually react with an impulse after watching different people from other groups. Eg. The recent discrimination is shown against North Eastern residents in India believing them as Chinese.</li><li><strong>Self Respect:&nbsp;</strong>Some times such kind of prejudicial steps are taken against an individual or a group just to boost up their own self-respect. When the self-respect of these people are threatened they perform prejudicial, racial discrimination against the others to reinstate their own self-respect.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In a nutshell, whatever we have derived from our colonial past must now be forgotten and such social backwardness within the society would not only stop the progress of a nation but also shatter the bonding amongst the people in a society.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-normal-font-size">China’s recent move for de-escalation was a massive swerve from its vehement actions, visible since last couple of weeks near the de facto border between India and China in <strong>Ladakh</strong>. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The world is facing a severe pandemic which is alleged to be “<strong>Made In China</strong>”. However, amid a disaster, we see incursions at <strong>Ladakh border </strong>(<strong>LAC</strong>) by Chinese troops which projects the objective of Beijing to expand its territory and economy as well, when the whole&nbsp;world is thriving to heal itself from a strike by an “<strong>invisible enemy</strong>”.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Till now we have seen a series of face-offs near LAC in Ladakh between both the troops. Reports have been mentioning intrusions by the Chinese troops in the Galwan River on the North of Pangong Tso, and perhaps at Hot Springs in Chang Chenmo River (a tributary of the Shyok river), and at Demchok. These Increase in military activities, positioning of helicopters (Chinook Helicopters spotted) along the 3,488 km long LAC have made local villagers as well as citizens of both the sides to speculate something terrifying. We&nbsp;did hear Chinese media putting allegations on New Delhi for blocking <strong>People’s Liberation Army</strong> (<strong>PLAs</strong>) patrols whereas, same allegations have been reiterated by Indian media as well as by the spokesperson of MEA Mr&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-rejects-chinas-claims-of-trespass/article31643363.ece">Anurag Shrivastava.</a></p>



<h3>Historical Overview:</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Amidst 1954, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/what-is-panchsheel-pact-all-you-need-to-know-2298469/">Panchsheel</a>&nbsp;document was signed proclaiming “<strong>Hindi Chini Bhai-&nbsp;Bhai”</strong>&nbsp;or one of the principle in&nbsp;the agreement was “<strong>mutual respect of each other’s borders</strong>”&nbsp;and still the situation worsened when China never walked the talk whereas on the other side&nbsp;it was under this pact where India officially accepted Tibet as <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/nepal-controversial-map-kathmandu-under-the-dragons-sway/">China’s</a>&nbsp;integral territory. In 1959 China refuses to accept the MC Mohan Line. 1993 was the year, the then prime minister P.V Narsimha Rao visits China and signs another agreement which was named&nbsp;“<strong>Peace And Tranquillity Agreement</strong>”. In 2002, both the neighbours signed an agreement to delineate in order to resolve border dispute within a reasonable time frame. Despite having signed number of agreements we had seen a 21 days <strong>standoff</strong> in Depsang plains in 2013, Doklam standoff in 2017 which was a 70 days long tussle, and now again we have a faceoff near the LAC. So the peaks and valleys betwixt the relations of both nations are distinctly evident.</p>



<h3>Autocrat Under Influence :</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Well, its crystal clear that President Xi Jinping is directly performing under the coercion of <strong>Communist Party Of China</strong> (<strong>CPC</strong>). As the term&nbsp;“<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-china-dream-vs-the-american-dream/">China Dream</a>”&nbsp;promoted by President Xi since 2013 which promises to recover and resolve all the territories of China by 2021 does not appear to be accomplished which has brought an immense compulsion over him to convince his performance to the Chinese, moreover CPC. President Xi has been trying to deflect the attention of the citizen of China and pump nationalist notion amongst the people and&nbsp;that’s the reason we see Chinese media, diplomats( who are being termed as wolf warriors, due to their aggressive appearance) even netizens attacking from all the sides.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Other Prospects&nbsp;For Dragon’s Belellicose near Ladakh And Other Corners Of The World:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The slowing GDP of China and its economy has been descending which plummeted more post <strong>COVID-19</strong>, though it tried to bring out an opportunity to become an imperium before the world recovers but the descending economy along with disturbances in <strong>Hongkong</strong> and glaring <strong>Taiwan</strong> has splashed water over its dreams. India remained the biggest market for China prior to the pandemic but the recent restrictions put forward by the Indian government over FDI&nbsp;rules may turn out as one of the possibilities of China’s&nbsp;retaliation near borders. Anyhow the countries after realizing Beijing’s negligence and&nbsp;non-transparent attitude have started closing their doors&nbsp;for “ Made In China” goods and&nbsp;services. The USA has virtually closed the American market for China, mentioned in its recently released strategic paper on 20th&nbsp;May. Europe is also in bad shape post-pandemic and is not in temper to tolerate China. Chinese themselves have assessed Anti- China global opinions. These circumstances might have made dragon to erase these patterns and put pressure on India and other countries.</li><li>Post Doklam standoff Chinese media has been comparing their equipments, weapons, aircrafts including those being supplied to Pakistan with India. There was an adverse reaction after the Doklam or Dolam crisis when China had two options either to escalate or to back off and it chose the second one. This is still bothering them especially the&nbsp;People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</li><li>&nbsp;After the issuance of India&#8217;s new official map depicting POK as our own has also brought the Chinese as well as Islamabad under fury as they have witnessed their finances and hold over the region under threat.</li><li>Speeding up of infrastructure build-up near the Ladakh border (LAC) has brought an inferiority complex within the PLA as they want India to remain on backfoot. Even developing a civilian infrastructure like laying pipelines in Demchok village near Ladakh border (LAC) has also been objected by the Chinese in that area. These situations might have led PLA under CPC to escalate the conditions and intrude in our borders. Conceited China&nbsp;imagines India won’t retaliate after its win in the <strong>1962 Sino-Indo war&nbsp;</strong>which was again launched when US and USSR were busy in the Cuban missile crisis. But China must recall 2017 Dolam standoff where it had to step back after Indian army’s staunch resistance. China’s actions are not always rhetoric but it tries to put pressure&nbsp;on the other side and flaunts its growing power over the region. If we analyze its move currently in the South China Sea it&nbsp;has been doing the same by destroying Vietnam’s&nbsp;boat, afterwards representing it as an accident.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Both the countries should respect the agreements signed in the past like Border Defense Cooperation Agreement (BDCA). But on the other side, India’s approach towards China&nbsp;should also be&nbsp;“<strong>Resolute On Borders, Reasonable In Diplomacy</strong>” which is the accurate&nbsp;move after analyzing the current situation. It’s the duty of our army to stay determined&nbsp;without any unnecessary political interference and simultaneously diplomatic warriors through available channels may play their role behind the scenes. India should also decide its allied partners who are like-minded sharing similar interests must come together against the despotism of a single nation trying to take over the new world order. While for now, India has decided not to back down along the Ladakh border (LAC) protecting the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat-Beg Oldie bridge which once metalled shall provide as access for military mobilization. PM Modi, Ajit Doval (NSA) and Bipin Rawat (CDS) all the three have been tracking the issue keenly and on a priority basis.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Although recently, a Chinese envoy to India<a href="https://www.oneindia.com/india/the-dragon-and-elephant-dancing-together-is-the-right-choice-says-chinese-ambassador-3095536.html">&nbsp;Sun Weidong</a>&nbsp;said “<strong>Elephant And Dragon Can Dance Together</strong>” but still the situation on the ground remains the same and that’s why China, swerving from an uncaring dragon to a dancing dragon is yet treacherous.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">The current proximity being observed between <strong>Nepal</strong> and <strong>China</strong> especially amid Kathmandu’s recent step of <strong>restructuring its national map</strong>, have led <strong>New Delhi</strong> to restructure its strategy in the Himalayas.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We saw a major decision taken by the Nepal government to depict Kalapani, Limpyadhura and Lipulekh as its own territory after launching its lately updated <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nepals-new-political-map-claims-indias-territories/article31632033.ece">official map</a> which was rejected by the Indian government later. The disagreement from Nepal’s side came after India’s home minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the newly built road with 80 km of distance, connecting Darchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The question to be raised now is on the duration of this major stand taken against India’s claim. It isn’t a concomitance that the Nepalese border controversy which was announced on May 20 coincided with the Indo-Sino border conflicts within a narrow time-frame in an area called “Finger-5” on the northern bank of the 134 km Pangong Tso lake on May 5 and another similar clash between Indian and Chinese troops in North Sikkim- Naku La on May 10. (<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/what-to-make-of-india-and-chinas-latest-border-clash/">source</a>). This provokes us to raise a genuine question, whether Kathmandu is under the Dragons sway?</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><br>Nepal is a landlocked country betwixt India and China with the Himalayas in the north, the plains in the south and this makes it dependent on either of the neighbouring countries for trade which is essential for its economy as being a small nation, geographically as well as demographically and is so far marked as “Least Developed Country” (<a href="http://therisingnepal.org.np/news/15869">LDC</a>) following the UN’s list. India is the biggest trade partner to Nepal yet frequent contentions keeps arising between both the countries major one of which has remained unsolved since years.</p>



<h3>Roots of Indo-Nepal dispute</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Ergo, this Antecedes us to 1816, when the roots of this dispute started mushrooming. The <strong>Treaty of Sugauli</strong> concluded between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal in this year. The pact maps the Mahakali river as the western boundary with India but different British maps certainly exhibited the source of the tributary at different places which were mainly due to underdeveloped and less defined surveying methodologies utilized at that time. The disparity in locating the source of the river have encouraged Nepal to restructure its official map according to its claims. But In 1962 Indo-China war, Indian forces had occupied Kalapani territory after which India has been controlling it unilaterally and claims it as the source of Kali river. The Indian side had already released its updated political map depicting Kalapani as a part of its territory along with POK as part of newly formed UTs, J&amp;K and Ladakh. New Delhi considers it as a part of Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand.</p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><br>While in contrast, the recent claims by one of Nepal’s online portal have raised questions, pointing out the technical reports of the Government Of <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/india-us-relations-post-indias-independence/">India</a> (GOI) of Garwhal-Kumaon region, was published by the GOI in 1911 AD which distinctly states that “Kuthi Yankti” originates from Kang (gang), which is also called as Limpiyadhura, accordant with the official documents. In the Nepali language here Ku stands for ‘black’ and Thi means ‘river’ which together forms ‘black river’ or Kali Nadi or Kali River as known commonly. Therefore, these documents make them put their claims over Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh.</p>



<h3>How is the Lipulekh Pass Important For India?</h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For Nepal it just being a territorial dispute, India carries strategic importance with respect to Lipulekh pass. Being surrounded by the neighbours, in this case, China, that remains averse to India’s interests and has developed its frontiers with large military troops and developed infrastructure, makes it essential for India too, to advance its border areas (which was realized after the 70-day Doklam standoff), resulting in the increase of mobility in the territory for to and fro of army men and heavy machines like tanks, fighter jets, weapons etc. mainly during wars. These views were also noted by “ The Standing Committee On Defence”, in its 2017-18 report. After the newly constructed 80 km road which goes up to the Lipu Lekh pass on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have come out as a boon for the yatris (pilgrims) travelling to ‘<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-new-indian-road-to-lipu-lekh-nepals-protests-and-the-strategic-importance-of-the-area-6413914/">Kailash Mansarovar</a>’ as it will reduce the time taken to travel to the mentioned home of Lord Siva located in Tibet.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Following all the conundrums regarding the quest for the authority over Kalapani Lipulekh Limpiyadhura, India legally holds the sovereign jurisdiction over the claimed territory. Still, both the countries being a neighbour to each other sharing similar culture need to move ahead of this push and pull rather should find out a mutually welcomed solution through deliberations utilizing bilateral channels and must emerge as strong partners in the region. But the recent steps were taken by the KP Oli Sharma’s regime soon after holding the power like introducing compulsory Chinese language in schools, joining in China’s Belt And Road Initiative (BRI), allowing or rather bearing Beijing’s involvement in the internal politics of Nepal etc. are worrisome and will have to uncover the black cloth over its eyes unless it&#8217;s too late. It should not ignore the dragon’s old yet bold policy of <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2019/dec/19/chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-2078207.html">debt trapping</a>. Countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Africa, Djibouti etc. have already got themselves trapped which should perhaps alarm the Nepalese government. They should ally with a pro-democratic regime like India which stands for Sustainability, Equality and Security for all in the region. On the same side, India should keep itself apart from the internal matters of Nepalese and must respect their sovereignty.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Thus, the way newly established bus route from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Janakpur-Ayodhya-bus-service">Ayodhaya</a>( the birthplace of Lord Ram) was connected to Jankakpur(the birthplace of Lordess Sita) in 2018 by Modi-Oli government, it should remind both the neighbours to ameliorate its impairing relations, slowly yet steadily and unfortunately not deteriorating it at someone else’s behest.</p>
