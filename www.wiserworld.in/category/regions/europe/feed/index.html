										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The Netherlands is a country that is known for being a welfare state. It is evident with the statistics results- it is having one of the lowest income inequality in the European Union (EU). Several <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/nordic-economic-model-is-the-grass-greener-on-the-other-side/">benefits </a>are provided to the citizens so that they could live a respectable livelihood. However, things started deteriorating due to the child care subsidies scandal that hit the country at the beginning of the year. It eventually resulted in the government&#8217;s collective resignation as the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the entire cabinet resigned on January 15, 2021. Mark Rutte was one of the longest-serving leaders in the world. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/world/europe/rutte-dutch-netherlands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[1]</a></p>



<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Mark Rutte was against the decision of resigning and subsequently dissolving the coalition government. He insisted that there is a need to have political stability in the wake of the pandemic. However, the coalition parties believed that a political backfire was bound to happen, and the consequences were unavoidable after the release of the parliamentary report.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-government-resigns-over-childcare-benefit-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only after this that in a press conference the Prime Minister said: &#8220;We are of one mind that if the whole system has failed, we all must take responsibility, and that has led to the conclusion that I have just offered the king, the resignation of the entire Cabinet.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepressjournal.in/world/dutch-prime-minister-mark-rutte-and-his-entire-cabinet-resign-over-child-welfare-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[3]</a></p>



<p>With this statement, he confirmed that he and his government take full responsibility for the scandal and submit their resignation to King Willem-Alexander van Oranje.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-and-his-entire-cabinet-quits-over-welfare-scandal-101610900452800.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, he reaffirmed that although he has resigned, he will play the role of the government&#8217;s role until the next general elections scheduled on March 17 this year. As per many political experts, there is a likely shift to the Dutch social policy left after this scandal. Nonetheless, one cannot deny that respite the resignation, and the Prime Minister has instead been able to escape relatively untouched successfully.</p>



<h2>What Is the Child Benefits Scandal?</h2>



<p>In the Netherlands, childcare is private. Under the tax department&#8217;s earlier policies, parents had to pay for childcare, but they did get subsidies that depended on their income. However, after Mark Rutte took over as the Prime Minister in 2010, several changes were made to the anti-benefit fraud laws. These measures were further taken in 2013 after authorities reported illegal methods used by Bulgarian crooks to collect such payments. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-23043543." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[5]</a></p>



<p>With the policies&#8217; changes, the tax department was given more power to make sure that such misuse of benefits does not occur. Also, this allowed the tax department to compensate for the seized funds.</p>



<p>However, things soon started going downhill when the negatives of these laws started impacting the Dutch citizens. Several parents lost both benefits and were further asked by the authorities to repay the child benefits that they had received in the past. It affected over 26,000 families, of which 10,000 households were forced to repay benefits. It led to bankruptcies, divorces and unemployment among those people.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/dutch-government-resigns-over-child-benefits-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6]</a>&nbsp;Even when the citizens contacted the authorities with their grievances, there was no genuine response.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-politics-resignation-idUSKBN29K1IO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[7]</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>These complaints soon started piling up and finally in 2017, the government-appointed an official to look into these complaints. On a thorough check, it was observed that a disproportionate number were of immigrant parents who lost the child benefits. When the need for further information was required for evidence gathering, the parliamentary inquires got only a little information from the ministries with most of the information blacked out. However, one thing was exact, and civil servants had cut child benefits to families from 2013 to 2019. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/dutch-government-resigns-after-childcare-benefits-scandal-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[8]</a>  </p>



<p>By the end of 2019, an estimated amount of € 500 million, about €30,000 ($36,300) for each family was set aside.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55674146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[9]</a>&nbsp;Also, the current scheme was decided to be expanded. and expanded compensation was set aside when the government accepted its mistake, although payments were not made.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/14/dutch-government-faces-collapse-over-child-benefits-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[10]</a></p>



<p>The final nail in the coffin was the parliamentary report, <a href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/20201217_eindverslag_parlementaire_ondervragingscommissie_kinderopvangtoeslag.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[11]</a> that brought out the government had falsely accused several parents of tax defrauding. It is a grave injustice done to the people of the Netherlands. In a separate investigation, the Dutch Data Protection Authority concluded that tax inspectors had discriminated against citizens with dual nationality. <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/belastingdienst-werkte-zeer-kritische-autoriteit-persoonsgegevens-tegen~b69beed9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[12]</a> </p>



<p>In November, a report&nbsp;<a href="https://taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The_State_of_Tax_Justice_2020_ENGLISH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[13]</a>&nbsp;ranked the Netherlands government is considered a leading global tax haven for large corporations. So the government chasing the individuals for such small amounts thus did not go unnoticed.</p>



<h2>Families Reaction to This Scandal</h2>



<p>Several families have been affected by these mishaps on the government&#8217;s side. So, they are suing the government. Ornaldo Kadir is an attorney who is currently representing over 600 families stated that it was predominantly immigrant Dutch citizens that were target due to the method of ethnic profiling. It used a particular algorithm that characterized immigrant dutch citizens of dual nationals to be a fraudster. Not only that, but even missing signatures were considered as a parameter by the tax authorities to brand the people as frauds. It was not only an injustice but also a violation of the constitution. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/dutch-government-quits-over-colossal-stain-of-tax-subsidy-scandal-11610728718467.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[14]</a></p>



<h2>Way Ahead</h2>



<p>Several ministers such as Health Minister Tamara Van Ark, Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, and former Tax Minister Menno Snel and opposition Labour Party leader Lodewijk Asscher have been named court documents.</p>



<p>The Leader of the Opposition Labour Party, Lodewijk Asscher who held the Social Affairs Minister, office from 2012-2017 has also stepped down from his current position due to the &#8220;unheard justice&#8221; done to people the Netherlands. It was his resignation that forced Prime Minister Mark Rutte to revisit his position on the issue. Eric Wiebes, Economic Affairs Minister, also resigned and stated that he would not be a part of the current guardian government.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ad.nl/dossier-vertrek-asscher/kabinetsval-dichterbij-blijven-zitten-terwijl-asscher-wel-zijn-conclusies-trekt-is-lastig-uitlegbaar~aff58082/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[15]</a></p>



<p>With the general elections scheduled in March, the current child benefits scandal is likely to significantly less impact Prime Minister Mark Rutte&#8217;s popularity. According to polls, it is expected that his People&#8217;s Party for Freedom and Democracy is likely to win a fourth term if he gets the largest share of votes. In other words, Mark Rutte&#8217;s VVD party is ahead of the far-right leader Geert Wilders&#8217;s party. If he wins, Prime Minister Mark Rutte would continue as the government&#8217;s head by forming a new coalition. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dutch-government-cabinet-mark-rutte-resign-child-welfare-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[16]</a></p>



<p>With this scandal, the Netherlands in the third European country to be caught up in a political crisis. Earlier, Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte had to <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/italian-politics-fallout-of-italys-government/">resign </a>due to falling in the majority after their coalition party led by Renzi backed out and also the government in Estonia had to resign due to a corruption scandal.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">On 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2021, Alexei Navalny was sentenced to a penal colony for two years and eight months by a Moscow court. <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/02/as-it-happened-navalny-sentenced-to-2-years-and-8-months-in-penal-colony-a72803">[1]</a> On 5<sup>th</sup> February, he was again summoned to court, where he was charged for insulting a war veteran.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/05/russia-to-try-navalny-on-wwii-veteran-slander-charges-a72841">[2]</a></p>



<p>However, the 2<sup>nd</sup> February verdict was enough for the Russians to come out in support of him. Thousands of supporters of Alexei Navalny poured onto the streets and marched towards central Moscow. These protestors clashed with police in body armour who was also armed with staves to control the protest. According to OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group state that over 1,000 protestors were arrested across the country the following day. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/02/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-jailed">[3]</a></p>



<p>It is indeed a controversial decision as Navalny is one of the most prominent Kremlin critics and Vladimir Putin&#8217;s foe. It is not the first time that some Kremlin critic is being put behind bars. Mikhail Khodorkovsky<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/mikhail-khodorkovsky-freed-putin-pardon-russia"> [4]</a> and chess world champion Garry Kasparov <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7iTyaOSRom9xGeF2OmaYUI/Former-chess-champion-Garry-Kasparov-quits-Russia-over-fears.html">[5]</a> are some of the people who were forced to leave Russia in fear of their lives for criticising Putin. However, Boris Nemtsov was not that lucky as he was shot dead in&nbsp;Kremlin, 2015. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition">[6]</a> It makes Alexei Navalny the last critic of the Kremlin to be standing alive and on Russian soil.</p>



<p>During the court visit, one could not miss noticing Alexei Navalny&#8217;s wife, Yulia. The verdict included the deduction by the judge of 10 months from the originally designated three-and-a-half-year sentence as Alexei Navalny had already spent that duration in house arrest. Yulia stepped out after the court session when Navalny smiled and shrugged his shoulders and yelled: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be sad! Everything is going to be all right&#8221;. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9252195/Russian-police-raid-Navalnys-offices-wife-Putins-greatest-critic-flees-Moscow-Germany.html">[7]</a> She waved back with Navalny&#8217;s two lawyers, Vladimir Kobzev and Olga Mikhailova. They have approached the European Court of Human Rights but to no avail. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-court-release-idUSKBN2AH1XI">[8]</a> However, all of these come as no news as Alexei Navalny is a nobody but one of the rising figures in Russian politics and a massive challenge to President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<h2>Who Is Alexei Navalny?</h2>



<p>Alexei Navalny is a lawyer turned activist. He is a very prominent critic of President Putin and his administration. However, to several Russians, he is not just a challenger to President Putin but is instead considered a contender to the leadership position. President Putin is a former KGB colonel who intends to continue controlling Kremlin for a few more decades. On the other hand, Navalny is seen as a revolutionary leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Navalny is a rising figure who has been a symbol of protest against President Putin&#8217;s grey bureaucratic hold and his colleagues from KGB in the Kremlin. Navalny is seen as an opponent by several Russian elites. He worked as an organiser for the liberal Yabloko faction in 2007. However, he was kicked out of the party in 2007 for participating in a march with radical nationalists in Moscow.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist/278186/">[9]</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>He came second in the mayor elections of 2013 with 27% votes, although he alleged that it was due to the authorities&#8217; ballot-rigging. Even though Sergei Sobyanin won the election, it cannot be denied that it was the first official challenge given by Navalny to President Putin. <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/news/general/2021-01-27/alexei-navalny-and-2013-moscow-mayoral-election">[10]</a> As a result, alleged corruption allegations were put on his to debarred from the 2018 elections. Not just him, even his allies are frequently prevented from holding any office. Now, in the Duma elections that will take place in September 2021, he and his allies want to challenge the United Russia party.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42479909">[11]</a></p>



<p>At the same time, Kremlin is getting ready to keep him away from one of the other reasons. Earlier as well, he has been jailed because of his connection to protests. He has also been convicted twice for financial misdeeds, although he claimed that they were politically motivated. Not only that, but he has also had significant eye damage due to a disinfectant thrown onto his face. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/russia-aleksei-navalny-opposition.html">[12]</a></p>



<h2>How Is Alexei Navalny a Challenge to President Vladimir Putin?</h2>



<p>Alexei Navalny gained prominence by using social media to reach out to people regarding matters concerning Russian politics. He makes videos on the Russian elites&#8217; various details that they would like to keep in the dark. Navalny has over 2.5 million Twitter followers and about 6 million YouTube followers. He uses these social media platforms to expose the truth about the sources of the Russian elites&#8217; wealth. One such video is that of President&nbsp;Putin&#8217;s secret Black Sea palace. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI">[13]</a> The video has garnered over 110 million views. Several other anti-corruption videos are made by him that tend to hit these Russian elites&#8217; personal lives and big-shot names in Kremlin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g">[14]</a> Thus, Navalny is no new to raids, lawsuits, threats, and jail stint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexei Navalny is evident in his objectives if he comes to power- to end corruption by state officials. Rampant state corruption has been one of Putin&#8217;s governance highlights, and President Putin is right in the centre of it stashing billions of dollars from strategic enterprises. It led Navalny to become a shareholder activist in 2007. He used his financial knowledge to purchase several shares of state-run firms that have a suspicious background.&nbsp;<a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1970475,00.html">[15]</a></p>



<p>He has several foundations based out form other countries to expose the corruption taking place in the Russian power centre. Moreover, he is not a one-person army. Several people are ready to fight this menace in Russia.&nbsp;Vladimir Ashurkov&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leonid Volkov&nbsp;is the director of the London based anti-corruption foundation <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/navalny-aides-push-eu-for-new-russia-sanctions/articleshow/80767361.cms">[16]</a> and is an aide of Navalny in Lithuania. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/navalny-ally-leonid-volkov-our-aim-is-to-outsmart-putin/a-56573967">[17]</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, President Putin has the state machinery in his realm as his tool to keep control over his critics. However, Alexei Navalny uses social media and his dark humour as a tool to keep up with other people. Many have come and gone, but Alexei Navalny is still standing. He has done something that no one could do before- get under President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s skin. He has been brave and has stood firm even when put in the worst of situations. President Putin so far, been unable to break him.</p>



<p>That is the reason why Kremlin has been trying to eliminate him for a year with different methods. Jail, lawsuits, raids, threats. Nothing has worked so far. So, the Kremlin decided to use the shadiest method under their belt to silence him once and for all. Last year, Navalny was poisoned in Siberia by an undercover team of Russia&#8217;s Federal Security Service (FSB) spy. They had applied &#8220;Novichok Nerve Agent&#8221; in the internal parts of Navalny&#8217;s underpants. It had earlier been&nbsp;used in 2018 on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal&nbsp;in Salisbury. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/skripal-salisbury-poisoning-decline-of-russia-spy-agencies-gru">[18]</a> However, Alexei Navalny was able to survive due to timely hospital treatment. Navalny was even able to&nbsp;expose the FSB assassins.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/21/what-does-alexei-navalny-say-the-duped-russian-spy-admitted-about-his-poisoning">[19]</a></p>



<p>With this attempt, the Kremlin finally thought they had got rid of Navalny. Even though he survived, they assumed that he would not return to Russian soil from Berlin, where he was recovering. Nevertheless, Navalny again proved them wrong when he flew back to Moscow on 17<sup>th</sup> January. It was seen as a direct challenge to President Putin. It was then he was detained from the passport control at Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo airport within hours of his arrival.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/alexei-navalny-detained-at-airport-on-return-to-russia">[20]</a></p>

<p>His lawyer Olga Mikhailova told the Echo of Moscow radio station that she could not meet her client. In other words, Navalny was denied legal representation. <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-lawyer-says-denied-access-to-moscow-police-cell-101610962827751.html">[21]</a> All of this culminated into street protests in over 100 towns and cities in&nbsp;Russia. <a href="https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/the-russian-affair-524975">[22]</a> From Crimea to Vladivostok on the Pacific, the streets were flooded with supporters. Protestors even gathered in- 50C in Yakutsk to show solidarity with their hero. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/world/europe/russia-protests-navalny.html">[23]</a></p>



<h2>International Condemnation of Alexei Navalny&#8217;s Arrest</h2>



<p>Not just Russians, but there has been an international outcry for human rights violation by both USA and European diplomats and leaders in this case. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden who is now a Russian citizen, Jack Sullivan, Joe Biden&#8217;s incoming national security adviser, and even Mike Pompeo are prominent names who voiced their opinion against the state brutality on Alexei Navalny. Not just them, but even US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, have described this act as being &#8220;deeply concerning&#8221;, &#8220;cowardice&#8221;, and a &#8220;bitter blow&#8221; to the rule of law in Russia respectively. <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/18/free-navalny-western-leaders-tell-russia-a72637">[24]</a></p>



<p>In a video conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a statement from Berlin- &#8220;We consider this expulsion unjustified and think it is another facet of the things that can be seen in Russia at the moment that are pretty far from the rule of law.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/relations-between-eu-and-russia-worsen-over-navalny-jailing/articleshow/80717773.cms">[25]</a></p>



<p>Showing solidarity with Germany, Poland, and Sweden, Macron stated, &#8220;I think this was a huge mistake even for Russian stability today.&#8221;&nbsp;Sweden&#8217;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mats Samuelsson said that &#8220;it considers this entirely unjustified, which we have also conveyed to the Russian side&#8221;. Stockholm &#8220;strongly rejects Russian claims that the diplomat took part in a demonstration in Russia&#8221; and &#8220;reserves the right to take appropriate response measures,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-macron-russia-idUSKBN2A42NJ">[26]</a></p>



<h2>Way Ahead</h2>



<p>Nonetheless, nothing seems to change the minds of the Russian officials in this case. To make matters worse, Kremlin went ahead with expelling EU diplomats on 5th February. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused diplomats of Sweden and Poland stationed in St. Petersberg and a diplomat of Germany stationed in Moscow of taking part in the protests on 23rd January to show support to Alexei Navalny. all the three diplomats were declared &#8220;persona non grata&#8221; and were ordered to leave shortly.<a href="https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/international/2021/02/06/fgn49-eu-russia-ld-navalny.html"> [27]</a></p>



<p>These have further worsened the situation and the EU&#8217;s possible attempt to re-engage talks with Moscow that EU Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell was spearheading. In retaliation to this, on 9<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;February 2021, Germany, Poland and Sweden on Monday each declared a Russian diplomat in their country &#8220;persona non grata.&#8221; All the Russian ambassadors were told to leave the country immediately. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-countries-expel-russia-diplomats-69e018425fa2d0bc9dde29aa1fad8c60">[28]</a></p>



<p>Whatever is happening or will happen, one thing is for sure Alexei Navalny did not lose anything from his prison sentencing. Locking up Navalny for a long time is bound to make him a martyr.</p>



<p>In 2013, when he was arrested, a large crowd had gathered that forced the authorities to leave him. Since then, President Putin is stringent on dissent moves like this. Nevertheless, keeping him long now will surely increase the protest and may lead to political instability. If he is released now, he will be a massive challenge in the Duma elections scheduled in September 2021. Either way, it seems like Alexei Navalny&#8217;s win and a loss to the &#8220;Vladimir, the Underpants Poisoner.&#8221; <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-navalny-speech/31082857.html">[29]</a></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">After 12 years, Municipal elections in Mostar, Bosnia have taken place whereby nationalists parties is believed will win a landslide victory. The city embodies hatred of the conflict that led to widespread mass killing. The leaders of today from these parties are campaigning on the lines of bread and butter rather than ethnicity which had brought Bosnia-Herzegovinia into war in the first place. The holding of the elections comes right after the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Agreement which brought an end to the mass violence in Bosnia. </p>



<h2>A Peek Into History of Bosnia Municipal Elections</h2>



<p>Since 2008, municipal elections had not been held in Bosnia as the SDA and HDZ parties could not agree on electoral rules. However, both the parties had drafted the budget together, although transparency lacked as citizens were unaware were the money was spent. In the present scenario, the citizens argue that elites have had abused power as they had been living on the money of the taxpayer and shied away from showing any responsibility towards them. The unemployment rate in addition had accelerated during this period. The establishment of a city council signifies hope in Bosnia. Multi-ethnic parties are <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2020/1217/In-a-Bosnian-municipal-election-hope-for-post-ethnic-politics">expected to win</a> councillor which is believed to be a positive sign, although the two-party nationalist majority had been the trend. Bosnian city has been the witness to the ethnical division between the Bosnian Muslims and the Serbs. In the collective memory of the Bosniaks, the horror of the genocide remains etched.</p>



<h2><strong>ETHNICITY AND RELIGION: CAUSES OF THE GENOCIDE IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINIA</strong></h2>



<p>Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a part of the Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia and Slovenia declared independence which thereafter saw military retaliation by the Republic itself. The violence that erupted in Yougolsovia in 1991 must be perceived as the first major conflict that occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, during this period there was no British intervention because it was argued that this was merely an internal dispute. It had been led by Milosevic, the President of the Republic of Serbia who had been invigorating violent uprisings of Serbian nationalist parties and envisioned an ethnically Serb-dominated state which was hailed by Dobrica Cosic, the most popular writer in Serbia. It was him who espoused that Slavs were the most superior of all the Balkans. </p>



<p>The Croats and Bosniaks, constituting 60 per cent of the population voted for secession which had been opposed by the Ethnic Serbs that led to violence. Gunmen had been deployed to instigate fear in the minds of the minorities. Thereafter, the necessity of cleansing this population began by the ethnic Serbs, first of which began by detaining the Bosniak or the Bosnian Muslims. Then there were deported by a train to Hungary. Many have become refugees, 40,000 of them been Muslims and it has been argued that the Local Red Cross was complicit in this genocide. Not only that, the Serbia militia forces had been supported by the then President (Gutman, Roy, 1993) Yet, it cannot be denied that the United Nations was established by then and could not prevent the Serbenican genocide. It has been argued that the soldiers of the United Nations Peacekeeping forces were complicit in this.</p>



<h2><strong>THE DAYTON AGREEMENT AND AN ANALYSIS OF ITS SUCCESS</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/BA_951121_DaytonAgreement.pdf">The General Framework Agreement for Peace </a>in Bosnia-Herzegovinia known by the name of Dayton Agreement of Peace ended the long-drawn conflict. An<a href="https://www.osce.org/bih/126173"> agreement </a>was officially reached in 1995 at Wright Petterson Air Force. The Agreement epitomized the triumph of diplomacy by the Western Powers. Annex 1A which is concerned with the deployment of the Implementation Force, whereas Annex 1B outlines regional stabilization, security measures and as well as principles regarding regional arms and ammunition. Although it was against the wishes of the Serb and Croatian ultra-nationalists, Bosnia had been announced as a unified state which allowed those displaced to return to their homes. </p>



<p>The Federation was established as well as the Republic of Srpska or Republic of Serbia was recognized as a political entity which was awarded rights to self-govern itself. The media has indeed portrayed the Serbs as the criminals of the genocide and the Commemoration Day only deepens this memory which is of despair. (Murphy, 2011) Nevertheless, Serbian leadership undermines the legitimacy of the Dayton Agreement. The US involvement has been heralded because of their might to end war-torn Bosnia. In addition to that, the Clinton administration wanted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/nov/10/bosnia-bitter-flawed-peace-deal-dayton-agreement-20-years-on">ensure</a> the signing of this agreement as he would be running for re-election campaign against Robert Dole.</p>



<p>Now Bosnia has three separate armies, police forces and a national government whose functioning can be clearly argued is only on paper. Power <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/balkans/bosnia-and-herzegovina/bosnia-s-future">remains</a> still in the hands of its nationalists who aim to prohibit refugees returning to their homes. However, it can be argued that the Dayton Agreement has succeeded only in the prevention of armed conflict after it had been signed. In addition, SFOR or the NATO-led force in failing in the execution of the agreement.</p>



<h2><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>



<p>The Municipal elections must be perceived as an indication of improvement in Bosnia as there will be the establishment of the City Council. It may lead to reconciliation as its leaders have forgone issues of ethnicity and ready to propound issues of employment and the economy. Nevertheless, it remains a necessity that the United Nations must play an active role in ensuring that the holding of the elections are not disrupted and can return to normalcy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">After months of instability in Italian politics, Italy&#8217;s government finally collapsed on 13th January 2021. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi withdrew his small party Italia Viva&#8217;s support. This move has put the country in a difficult political situation as the government is now short of a parliamentary majority. However, the real problem is that this kind of political instability in Italian politics is rising when Italy is battling COVID-19. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 2.3 million Covid-19 cases and 79,819 deaths recorded. [1]</p>



<p>Nevertheless, such a political crisis is not new to the country. Italy has always been at the centre of political turmoil for decades. It is quite evident with the fact that the country has seen about 60 governments since WWII. Conte and Renzi&#8217;s drift has been known to the public for a long time, and hesitation escalating was very much anticipated. So far, the drift was kept at bay by this centre-left coalition due to the coronavirus emergency. However, the pandemic situation has also now escalated, and it seems that it outlasted the political goodwill. [2]</p>



<h2>Why Did the Problem in Italian Politics Start?</h2>



<p>The reason for this drift started due to the approach of Conte and Renzi concerning financial matters. [3] Back in 2020, the GDP of Italy slumped by about 10% due to COVID-19. [4] Adding on to that, was a stimulus package that was given by the European Union (EU) worth €750 billion that was allocated to several EU nations. In July 2020, Italy was allowed to get the lion share of the EU stimulus package, amounting to over €200 billion (about $243 billion) in a grant and low-interest loans. [5] Because of such loans, Italy is now the second most debt-ridden economy after Greece. [6]</p>



<p>For weeks, Matteo Renzi had criticized the plan laid out by Conte to use the EU funds to use these handout purposes and less on serving the health needs. Even when the plan was improved on Tuesday night as per the request, Matteo Renzi was still not satisfied. Finally, the usage of €200 billion worth of that package was approved during the night of about 12th and 13th January 2021 by the lawmakers. However, the lawmakers of the Italia Viva abstained from voting on it. Also, two members of resigned including Elena Bonetti, the former minister for family and equal opportunities. &nbsp;Both Conte and Renzi have a different opinion on how this recovery money given by the European Union should be used.</p>



<p>It increased the difference between Renzi and Conte, as the issue became a matter of political vote bank and both the centrists are competing for the same voters. [7]</p>



<p>Matteo Renzi&#8217;s move has been met with a mixed response, ranging from anger to confusion to chaos. One opinion poll even suggested about 70% of the Italians feel that this move by Renzi is not due to the difference of opinion, but rather for his political gain. Some experts also state that this move by Renzi may be due to him being side-lined by the coalition in recent times. [8] So, Renzi was doing nothing but using this opportunity to improvise on his political gains.</p>



<p>However, on Wednesday, Renzi argued in a news conference that dealing with the pandemic also meant &#8220;solving problems, not concealing them,&#8221; He has taken issue with Conte&#8217;s strategy for rebuilding Italy&#8217;s tattered economy.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that Matteo Renzi is a very well-known political figure in Italian politics and holds an even more crucial role in the current government headed by Giuseppe Conte.</p>



<h2>Why Renzi Is Crucial to the Italian Government?</h2>



<p>Italia Viva was formed by Matteo Renzi in September 2019, after he quit the centre-left Democratic Party. After the populist right-wing League Party&#8217;s departure, Renzi and his party played a significant role in forming the coalition government by Conte. The coalition government comprises the centre-left Democratic Party, Five Star Movement (MS5) and the left-leaning parliamentary group called Free and Equal.</p>



<p>According to recent polls, even though Renzi has only 3% public support, his party Italia Viva has 30 lawmakers in the lower house and 18 lawmakers in the upper house, thereby making them a junior coalition partner.</p>



<h2>Way Ahead</h2>



<p>Renzi had elected as the Prime Minister in 2014. So, he understands how the situation prevails while on that post and how politics needs to be done to rule the state. Not only that, but he also has been known for mediating conflicts among parties having varied political inclination- ensuring that the far-right parties are out of power by making sure that a coalition is created between populist and centre-left parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the decision of Renzi, there are only a few alternative options that can be viable for moving ahead in this situation. First, that Conte and Renzi come to a compromise by keeping the current coalition government. In other words, without escalating the situation, Conte needs to convince Renzi to support the government. It is still possible as Renzi is still. However, if this does not happen, the country would be on the brink of losing a government in the middle of a pandemic. Alternatively, the Conte government can go through a no-confidence motion. If he loses, the situation of Conte&#8217;s government will be like Schrödinger&#8217;s cat. In other words, Conte would only be left as the caretaker of the government, and he would also not have much power over Renzi. However, a coalition is still possible. After all, with a lack of public support, Renzi would not want to put his 48 lawmaker seats at risk. Nonetheless, if this not, the situation may move ahead in a different path.</p>



<p>Second, if the coalition government does not move ahead, then considering the pandemic, a government of national unity will be sought to be created by President Sergio Mattarella.</p>



<p>Third, the country could go ahead with the national vote. It would mean that the country may end up going into an election right in the middle of the pandemic. In case of an election, either Conte would win the third term as the Prime Minister, or the far-right wing parties would form the government. The far-right in Italian politics comprises of the League Party and the Brothers of Italy. They have been gaining support for the past few years and hold about 40% of the electoral vote. So, in case an election happens and the far-right wins, then there Italy will have the most anti-European government in Western Europe. [9]</p>



<p>In this way, one can state that Italy is currently in such a political situation that it will not be suitable for the nation if escalated. [10] Hence, sorting out the differences is the best possible way out of this situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gone are the days when it was believed that the sun never sat on the British Empire. The United Kingdom today maintains a landmass only a fraction of the size of its Empire, and in the last few decades, specifically, after the second world war, has been overshadowed by economic giants, such as India, China, and the United States. Departing finally from the European Union, the Conservative Government under Boris Johnson is rewriting the history books. After what could be only hundreds of hours of discussion on the floors of the Palace of Westminster, and a never-ending political ping pong, the UK finally achieved to negotiate a deal with Brussels. While several political pundits have been scratching their heads in an effort to understand the effects of <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/brexit-britains-divorce-from-european-union/">Brexit</a> on both the UK and EU, many have seemingly overlooked its effects on other regions of the world, particularly the Middle East, where Britain enjoys a long history of Imperialism.</p>



<p>There is no denying the fact that the United Kingdom had a significant impact on the European Union’s Foreign Policy. Brexit, in terms of the Middle East, the UK has shared the same concerns as the leadership in Brussels. This has included securing the flow of oil, ensuring non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and combating radical groups. However, cooperation with continental Europe has not always been the UK’s top priority when it came to Foreign Policy. As seen most notably in 2003 when the British government, under Labour Prime Minister joined the US-led coalition in invading Iraq, abasing strong criticism from Germany and France. To analyze Great Britain’s withdrawal from the confederacy, we look at three specific effects.</p>



<h2><strong>EU&#8217;s Loss of Power</strong> — Brexit &amp; Middle East</h2>



<p>We have already established the centrality of the British in the European Union’s economic development, foreign policies, and trade activities. Given the UK’s heightened power with the confederation, Brexit has not only left a gaping wound within the EU but has also shown the fragility of the union. Cracks within the European Union are so evident that political experts and heads of state, have entertained the possibility that the confederation may eventually break down completely. Since the Brexit referendum, there have been various right-wing discussions across European countries. The most glaring example of this is Poland. There has been a set of disagreements between the Polish government and the European Commission over contentious judiciary reforms. </p>



<p>The seriousness of the disagreements between the two entities is reflected through the words of the European Council President Donald Tusk who said, “The Matter is dramatically serious. The risk is deadly serious. Polexit is possible.” A similar situation of contention has developed between Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Hungarian right-wing government, which has been at odds with the EU, ever since the union voted overwhelmingly to label Orban’s government as a “systemic threat to the rule of law”. Given the current state of the Union, a weaker and inward-looking Europe is predicted to be less involved in the Middle East. The nature of Europe’s dealings with actors in the Middle East will significantly be altered as it strikes to bargain with authoritarian figures in maintaining border security and stability while paying lip service to its values and ideals. In terms of seeing the actual effects of Europe’s or the UK’s dealings with the states of the Middle East, post-Brexit, it will be interesting to see if the EU still enjoys its power to promote its values of the rule of law and democracy, given the significant erosion in soft power after the Brexit.</p>



<h2><strong>UK&#8217;s Interventionist Policy</strong> </h2>



<p>The second aspect that we focus on is the prediction that the United Kingdom may adopt an interventionist policy following Brexit — Even though, in regards to the Middle East, historically the UK has followed an independent foreign policy. Breaking away from the European Union, grants the country freedom from its regional commitments to mainland Europe and could lead to a more pragmatic and self-interested approach to its dealing with Middle Eastern states. </p>



<p>With the UK adopting a more selective role in the region, it is expected that the country will pursue short term goals over long term goals. This might include its interests in fighting terrorism and promoting UK business, rather than focusing on establishing a peace process in states like Syria. This however does not mean that the British will overlook the peace process completely. Being an important stakeholder in the Middle East Peace Process is vital for the country to maintain its relevance and influence in the region. If anything, a post-Brexit future may be the most ideal time for Britain to assert itself in the Middle East region, especially as the EU could be further weakened by Britain’s future departure and its internal problems. In terms of the business expansion in the Middle East, the Global Risk insight has predicted that the country will extensively focus on the Gulf region, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<h2><strong>Regional and International Actors</strong></h2>



<p>Given the probability of the EU adopting a more inward-looking policy and the UK following a more self-interested pattern in its interactions with Middle Eastern Actors, there is a possibility that this could result in a greater role for global powers such as China, to develop strategic partnerships and political alliances with the countries in the region. There could also be an increased role of regional actors in combating security dilemmas and economic issues through the involvement of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In terms of the Council, the GRI has predicted that blocks such as the GCC will step-in to essentially develop security and economic frameworks to address regional issues. However, this seems a bit too idealistic given the current political issues the Middle East is plagued with, and the splintering of various member states into their network groups, such as the Saudi-Emirati Coordination Council.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>From our discussion on the effects of Brexit, it is clear that the process has not only redefined relations between the Middle East, the United Kingdom and the European Union and reshuffled the intentional economy, but also has the potential of significantly altering Europe&#8217;s and the UK’s relations individually with other international actors. There exists tremendous insecurity and anxiety in markets around the world, as experts stand by to see the effects of these changes. A great amount of diffidence can be felt in the case of both the EU and the UK, as both remain unsure of how Joe Biden, the President-elect of the United States of America might react to the current situation. Had the Brexit deal gone through under Trump we could have expected him to adopt a more pro-British stance, but with Biden, the ball can be in anyone&#8217;s court. Only time will truly tell.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">After UK left EU, a long time of three years of bartering still it has not yet decided how to end the trade and tension between the two, after a long time of agreeing to new rules for how to live, work and trade together the leaders are still negotiating over time to reach a deal after Brexit.</p>



<p>Let’s travel back to the past, what is actually Brexit is and why it’s catching the whole news at once. United Kingdom joining EEC (European economic community) in 1973 as a  predecessor to the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/european-union-an-economic-case-study/">European Union</a> brings a lot of spilt. The Guardian wrote in an editorial on January 1, 1973 “ The journey into Europe will be bumpy and discordant.</p>



<h2>A Quick Glimpse Into the Past Events Which Led to Brexit</h2>



<p>During the WW1 and WW2, the European countries were also going through some conflicts in between them, slowly those conflicts turned out to be bloody wars. Simply, to rescue the neighbouring countries of Europe, EU comes into power with its founding members Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. European Union was originally the European Economic Community (EEC) created by the treaty of Paris in 1957. The United Kingdom joined in 1973. The main purpose of the European Union was to form a single European political entity and maintain a peaceful balance between all member countries with four basic freedoms regarding the transportation of goods, trade between member countries, common currency and free movement of people. In simpler terms, the EU consists of a group of European countries that acts as a single economic unit in the world economy.&nbsp; EU provides a peaceful balance to the countries and help to make a stronger economy of each country and offers opportunities to rely on each other. However, the EU also strictly maintains some<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b17f108-2cbd-44de-a829-d1bd910faa2e"> rules and regulation </a>on these member countries.</p>



<p>When it comes to the UK leaving EU, there’s a lot of news going on. To cover the huge topic in a go, the understanding of UK and EU is a long but bumpy journey and is much important. The United Kingdom joined the EU for the better economic and peaceful life of the citizen. After two years of UK joining EU brings a debate around into two parties, one section of the UK were not really happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU.&nbsp; According to that section of society, the EU has been a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-47213842">toxic issue</a> in British politics.&nbsp;They always fear that the EU may hamper the sovereignty of the UK and also can bring fundamental conflict. Britain&#8217;s future with the EU had no luck, that was strongly believed by a larger section of society, also many citizens and politician were not happy with the rules and regulation imposed by the EU. Although the other half who were not very happy with the freedom that comes other Britain’s exit of EU, the youth of Britain is torn between their idea of what Britain could be and the reality of what it is. So to make a decision and end the debate and protest between the two parties of The United Kingdom, a referendum took place in 2016. On 23 June 2016, British citizens were called to cast their vote on the subject of the UK’s membership in the European Union that had a remarkable turnout of 72 per cent of the total electoral voted YES to the Brexit.</p>



<h2>Xmas with Brexit Trade Deal</h2>



<p>For the British and European Parliaments to ratify a trade agreement in an orderly fashion before the Brexit transition period expires on New Year’s Eve. The UK insists that it should trade with the bloc with as few restraints as possible. The EU demands that Britain stick to EU rules to ensure fair competition.</p>



<p>After the long discussions, talks and conference call about 90 minutes between the prime minister Boris Johnson and the president Ursula von der Leyen, with the spirit of Christmas 2020, EU and UK comes to finalize their situation with ‘a lose-lose situation’ the deal is about signed in December 31st 2020.  The  EU’S chief negotiator Michel Barnier express regret saying there is no winner in Brexit. Ursula has said, &#8220;parting is always bitter and sweet, after successful negotiation journey throughout Brexit, the deal has been made in the Xmas eve, I feel satisfaction and relief.&#8221; A bittersweet moment has emerged in the air of the UK. Although the youth are not happy with the whole idea of Brexit but the deal has been made which is better then no deal, if the deal did not happen the situation in the UK will be worst. The deal prevented some worst situation for the United Kingdom. So after this long time with lots of news, protest and discussion, along with the deal made, the UK has become a completely unchartered territory. Britain is free from the EU, and the European Union has lost a member from its union.  A lot of compromise from both sides made possible the Brexit trade deal.</p>



<p>The deal that has made between the UK and EU stated that European boat will still drop nets in British water, giving up only 25% of their catch quotas as fishing becomes the most important part of the economy of both also the Brexit trade deal.  Due to the Brexit deal, the EU is going to reduce quota as EU vessels can get in and the UK can go back. No tariffs or quotas on the movement of goods tariff-free or free trade as there are non-tariff barriers lots of from filling. So there will be no tariffs and quotas but some bureaucratic barriers to trade. There’s quite more stuff including the UK going to stay in certain EU’s programs, free movements of person will be removed along with goods and services, also the Brexit deal does not provide financial equivalence to UK’s economy. After all this there will be a partnership council is going to take over.</p>



<p>After the Brexit deal the leaders of both UK and EU on the positive side of maintaining the strong relationship between the both UK and EU, also looking forward to more stability and certainty towards a new beginning with a new security and trade deal post Brexit, which runs to 2,000 pages.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As we draw closer to the end of this year, we often find ourselves reflecting on the year we have had, and how the COVID 19 pandemic has altered our lives. However, we overlook several events on a global scale that changed the socio-economic fabric of our societies. One such event was the Black Lives Matter Movement, which developed as a result of police brutality aimed towards people of color. The most recent country to have faced the effects of such brutality aimed at one particular section of society is the French Republic. The country had experienced two significant events in the past months, that have significantly affected the law and order situation of the country within two weeks. Paris last week lit up in flames as tensions between the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/5/france-violence-erupts-in-new-paris-protest-against-security-law">protestors and the police escalated</a>. Rallies organized by the citizens along with members of the Yellow vests, a populist, grass-roots movement, were disrupted by scores of protestors dressed in complete black, who launched projectiles at riot police. Tensions reached a new high after the protests started damaging public property, which included, breaking of windows of supermarkets and bank branches and setting ablaze several cars. In response to these acts, the police retaliated with tear gas and periodic charges against the crowd.</p>



<p>The previous weekend’s protests were the second time the French public took to the streets in the last month. There has been a sudden call for action amongst the citizenry, mainly due to two reasons. The first being the unwarranted <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/paris-protests-police-clash-with-protesters-as-violence-flares-at-anti-security-bill-demonstrations-12152236">beating of Micheal Zecler</a>, who by profession is a music composer. Zecler was kicked and punched for several minutes by three officers at his studio in Paris on the 21st of November. Over and above the ‘intentional violence’ charge, all four officers have been accused of forgery. A charge that is related to the police report filed after the incident, which stated that police officers acted in the following manner after they smelled cannabis and the fact that Mr. Zecler had resisted being searched. According to the prosecutor, the police officers involved agreed that they had acted out of panic, after Micheal Zecler, resisted them in the cramped surroundings of his office. The incident immediately caught the public’s attention. President Emmanuel Macron himself described the incident as “unacceptable” and “shameful”, demanding quick government proposals on how to rebuild trust between police and citizens.</p>



<p>In terms of the broader topic of contention between the authorities and the general public, we see a great amount of dissatisfaction resulting from the Micheal Zecler case, however, this dissatisfaction soon turned into frustration, which in turn led to a call for action after the French parliament tabled a security bill. Article 24 of which makes it a criminal offence to publish images of on-duty police officers with the intent to harm their “physical and psychological integrity”. Advocates of the proposed bill say that the legislation aims at protecting police officers from harassment and targeting on social media. On the other hand, a majority of the French population believes that media freedom and the citizens’ right to film police action must not be impeded, as the French police are under intense scrutiny and have received severe backlash, after the Zecler case.</p>



<p>In response to the recent protests and strong criticism, the government has received. Macron’s ruling party said that they plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55115659">rewrite the article</a> that curbs rights to circulate images of police officers. President Emmanuel Macron himself has acknowledged the fact that people of color are more likely to be stopped by police for ID checks than white. To deal with this problem he proposed setting up a platform for citizens to log unwarranted searches. The President’s recent remarks have, however, not settled well with the police unions, who have strictly denied the statement by the President. What remains to be seen is if the steps proposed by the ruling party and the President will be enough to pacific the people, so at the draw to a close the string of protests around the country, and more importantly to see if the steps will be enough from a substantive point of view.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/the-evolving-role-of-nato-a-brief-history-future-challenges/">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) was established in 1949 with the sole aim of ensuring security and to safeguard its alliance&#8217;s protection through military mechanisms. In the present scenario, NATO has not been able to counter the regional conflict that is emerging between countries, Greece and Turkey. The membership of Greece and Turkey to the NATO was offered to both the countries in 1952, believing that this would alter the contour of their relationship. President Harry Truman had granted memberships to both Greece and Turkey believing that they would enact as a bulwark to communism. Turkey’s support to Western values and perception of it as a stable democracy indeed attracted attention and increasing support from the West. Not only that, she has enacted as a buffer to the Middle East and Russia. On the other hand, if Turkey would be expelled, funding would have to be drastically escalated.  However, it is rather important to understand the genesis of such a dispute that has assumed an international acreage to it. It was in 1570 that Cyprus had come under the rule of the Ottoman Empire which had a sizeable Turkish population settling in this region. Indeed, the enemies in both countries have experienced a buildup of a stereotypical image as well as ‘otherness’ through literary texts, historiography and education. However, Turkey’s atrocities on the minorities beginning with the Armenian Massacre in 1894-1896 and thereafter the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/nagorno-karabakh-a-region-embedded-in-ethnic-violence/">Armenian Genocide</a> in the 19<sup>th</sup> century steered the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France to intervene. Not only that, Turkey perpetrated ethnic cleansing of its Greek minorities in 1922 when nationalism was on the rise (Kaloudis, George, Cyprus: The Enduring Conflict, 1999, pp: 40). World War I only accentuated the diplomatic ties shared between the countries. Yet, colonization of this region in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by the British Empire was a repercussion of the Ottoman Empire’s loss of territories during World War I, by which Cyprus was ceded.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.lepetitjuriste.fr/the-unresolved-cyprus-problem/">Cyprus conflict</a> has remained remarkably a major bone of contention between the Greek and Turkish communities as the 1950s witnessed the unleashing of inter-communal violence. It was the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters, a guerilla force which rebelled against the British Raj during this period that compelled the United States and the United Kingdom to rethink its foreign policies. On the other hand, a paramilitary group was established by the Turkish Cypriots which became known as the Turk Mukavemet Teshkiati or TMT. Rather, enosis has fitted well into the vision of pan-Hellenism or the Great Idea, known also as the “Megali Idea” and has been the sole goal for Greek Cypriots since British colonization and even after its independence. With no assistance from the United Nations, enosis had to be forgotten and a compromise was sought for, whereas the British authority realized the dominance of Cyprus military bases would fulfill its strategic necessities (Bishku, Michael M, Turkey, Greece and the Cyprus Conflict, 1991, p: 169). Therefore, independence of Cyprus was sought by Archbishop Makarios, the Greek Cypriot as the formidable choice, although many Greek Cypriots demanded union with Greece, termed as “enosis” which was refuted by Turkish Cypriots as they believed partition known by the nomenclature of “taksim” was the only solution. However, Makarios desired for alteration in the constitution which the Turkish Vice President, Dr Fasil Kucuk feared would sabotage their minority rights and led to inter-communal fights. The new constitution for Cyprus was then ratified on 16th August 1960. However, London and Zurich Agreements became the foundation of the three treaties as well as the embodiment of the constitution of 1960. By this, the presidentship would be headed by a Greek Cypriot whereas the position of the Vice-President must be awarded to a Turkish Cypriot. The Treaty of Establishment defined the territory of the Republic which excluded the British military bases; the Treaty of Guarantee which erased enosis as a proclamation and permitted Great Britain, Turkey and Greece to engage in ensuring the constitutional and institutional integrity of the Republic. Lastly, the Treaty of Alliance stated the utilization of Greek and Turkish servicemen to be working towards the defence of the region. It was again in 1963 that peaceful co-existence between communities was disrupted when the Greek Junta, a paramilitary group overthrew the government of President Makarios. The purpose was to demand reunification with Greece and as a result of this, Turkey deployed troops in Cyprus in 1974 which finally cumulated into the partition of this region. Northern Cyprus was occupied by Turkey and Southern by the Greek counterparts. Nevertheless, because of the existence of allegiance of both the communities in Cyprus to their motherlands, namely Greece and Turkey has resulted in absenteeism of patriotism in this region (Kaloudis, George, Cyprus: The Enduring Conflict, 1999, pp: 7).</p>

<h3><strong>Quandary: Defining the Turkey-Greece Diplomatic Ties</strong></h3>



<p>The Aegean is a semi-closed sea which separates the mainland constitutes to function as a bickering territory between Greece and Turkey. The former <a href="https://fpc.org.uk/the-recent-crisis-between-greece-and-turkey/">argues </a>that Turkey has been violating Greek sovereignty, whereas the latter believes that Greece has been aiming to turn the Aegean into a Greek lake. In 2017, a Turkish vessel had been shot down by the Greek coastal guard and it was in April 2018 that two patrol boats came neck to neck in Kardak islets. It was in July 2020 that Turkey was sending a research ship which would carry out a survey over the close to Kastellorizo, which covered the region between Cyprus and Crete. Rather, the conflict has become militarized as both countries are mobilizing ships in the Mediterranean. Thereafter, Ankara had signed a deal with Libya to establish an Exclusive Economic Zone or EEC from the Turkish southern coast to Libya’s north-east coast. Both Cyprus and Greece stated that the treaty violates the International Law of Sea or the United Nation Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS). Both have accursed this move as they perceive that this may emerge as a barrier to the development of the Eastern Mediterranean. Not only that, Greece was horrified when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan decided to transform the Hagia Sophia museum into a mosque, which is a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) heritage site. This museum had been built by the Roman Emperor, Justinian in the year 537 CE. This was condemned by the Eastern Orthodox Church, based in Greece. These instances have only accentuated the relationship which is fuelled with animosity.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Turkey’s history of such acts against the minorities constitutes what she envisions himself: a visionary leader. No doubt, she believes that expansionism can give her this recognition. NATO must remain true to its core values which have been its foundation, yet her indecisiveness to take a stand in Greece and Turkey conflict has proved to be fatal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Terror struck France once again after a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/opinion/france-terrorism-muslims.html">Islamist terror attacks </a>that took place in October 2020. First, a history professor, Mr Samuel Paty was decollated near Paris by a young Chechen man, after he showed cartoon images of Prophet Mohammad wearing a bomb instead of a turban, in a class on free speech. The image was published in Charlie Hebdo’s magazine, which stirred a good amount of unrest among Muslims across the world. Following this attack, three people were killed at a church in the southern city of Nice. The prime suspect of this terror attack is a Tunisian man who reportedly yelled “Allahu Akbar” at the police officers.</p>



<p>These attacks set in motion a chain of action. Minister of Interior Gérald Darmanin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/opinion/france-terrorism-muslims.html">announced </a>the elimination of people who spread hate through the internet. Baraka City which is a humanitarian NGO has been dissolved by the government because it took pleasure in such terror attacks. The government has additionally, threatened to ban Le Collectif Contre l’islamophobie en France, a nonprofit organization that claims to combats anti-Muslim racism: According to Mr Darmanin, the C.C.I.F.’s work is against the Republic of France.</p>



<p>After the attacks, Macron spoke in favour of Mr Paty by reaffirming the right to free speech, including the right to satire and blasphemes. President Emmanuel Macron believes that Mr Paty was killed for embodying the French Republic and vowed to hold “<a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/secularism-and-religious-freedom-in-france-63815/article/fight-against-separatism-the-republic-in-action-speech-by-emmanuel-macron">laïcité</a>” up high. This has angered Muslims not only in France but all around the world. Thousands of people in Pakistan, Lebanon, and other Palestinian territories entered into a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/as-anger-rises-thousands-of-muslims-protest-french-cartoons/articleshow/78952001.cms">fury </a>after Macron vowed to protect the right to caricature the Prophet Mohammad. The decision of the Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish the cartoon caricature has also been seen as an act of violence against Muslims. A crowd in Bangladesh was seen burning an effigy of Macron, while a rally in Pakistan resorted to throwing stones at the police who were trying to control the angry mob. France itself remains on edge after the attacks and Macron ordered 7000 soldiers to guard the schools and religious sites. Macron’s latest speech in favour of the caricature has skewered&nbsp;relations between Turkey and France further. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/10/31/terror-attacks-france-over-mohammad-images-spark-free-speech-debate/6082543002/">accused </a>Macron of Islamophobia and went ahead to question his mental health. Erdoğan has since then called on Muslim countries to&nbsp;boycotts all&nbsp;French goods.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="976" height="549" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/115145311_064095097-1.jpg" alt="Anti-France rally in Bangladesh" class="wp-image-3757" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/115145311_064095097-1.jpg 976w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/115145311_064095097-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/115145311_064095097-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /><figcaption><em>Anti-France rally in Bangladesh (Source: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-54751920">BBC</a>)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dalia Mogahed, a former advisor on faith for former US President Barrack Obama, now a research director of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/10/31/terror-attacks-france-over-mohammad-images-spark-free-speech-debate/6082543002/">claimed </a>that the President of France was wrong to support a cartoon caricature that “pits freedom of speech against blasphemy”. She said that the cartoons clearly showed how the country is suffering from Islamophobia. She said, “They are the equivalent of the N-word. They are equivalent of blackface. They are racial slur.&#8221; The cartoons &#8220;target a vulnerable, marginalized, disempowered and demonized community by a powerful institution,&nbsp;which is&nbsp;then further demonized, sometimes by the state,&nbsp;for protesting those slurs.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the attacks took place, Emmanuel Macron had spoken about the new government plans to combat separatism. In his Republic in Action: Speech, he differentiates between Islam and Islamic terrorism. He said, “Let’s not fall into the trap of conflating issues, set by polemicists and extremists, which consists in denouncing all Muslims. That trap is what the enemies of the Republic set us; it consists of making all citizens of the Muslim faith objective allies because they are supposedly the victims of a well-organized system. Too simplistic.”</p>



<p>“What we must tackle is Islamist separatism. A conscious theorized, the political-religious project is materializing through repeated deviations from the Republic’s values, which is often reflected by the formation of a counter-society as shown by children being taken out of school, the development of separate community sporting and cultural activities serving as a pretext for teaching principles which aren’t following the Republic’s laws. It’s indoctrination and, through this, the negation of our principles, gender equality, and human dignity.”</p>



<p>Therefore, we see that the President’s notion of separatism assumes that a minority of Muslims are setting themselves apart from French society and creating their societies in the suburbs. The problem here is that the speech portrays Muslims as being immature, which is far from true. Many studies have shown that the Muslim community is well integrated. According to a <a href="https://www.ifop.com/publication/les-musulmans-en-france-30-ans-apres-laffaire-des-foulards-de-creil/">study </a>in 2019, 70% of &nbsp;Muslims claimed that they were allowed to practice their religion freely. 41% said that they should adopt some of the principles of laïcité as French citizens and 37% said that they wished laïcité to be more flexible. The Muslims do not criticize the age-old republic version of the 1905 law about the separation of the State and Church. They attempt to criticize the recent interpretations of the law that seems to blame the Islamic community for terror events.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In his <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/remmm/10331">research</a>,<strong> </strong>Vincent Geisser found that many Muslims called upon the mosque to pray for the preservation of France. Many others also grieved for non-Muslims who were victims of Islamist terror attacks. It has been observed by the Centre of Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC-based think tank, which the US right-wing was responsible for 76% of the attacks but the Islamic extremists were blamed for them. Many argue that a vast majority of French Muslims are equally horrified by the terror attacks but feel the entire community cannot be stereotyped because of the actions of a few. However, many others in France now feel the urgent need to protect French secularism from what they see as a fundamentalist Islamist onslaught. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The wedge between not only the Muslim community and the rest of the world but amongst every religious community is not new and has had a notorious effect on us. In Uttar Pradesh, renowned poet, Munawwar Rana was <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/poet-munawwar-rana-booked-for-remarks-on-france-attacks/article33004769.ece">arrested </a>by the police for spreading the already existing enmity between communities, when he said that he would kill whoever made an obscene cartoon of his father or mother, he would kill that person. He went on to say that he would feel like killing whoever made obscene and objectionable cartoons of Sita, Lord Ram, and other gods and goddesses. While anger revolving around the insult of one’s religion is understandable, the easy usage of the terms “killing” and actual murders for it is unacceptable and only shows how deeply religion is rooted in the minds of the people and the depths to which an individual, irrespective of his or her age, is willing to go.</p>



<p>Religion and actions based on religion have always been a hot topic of debate for women and men around the world and such terror attacks make one wonder how far this fight amongst the various communities will go.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap" id="block-c85d7eca-8261-41de-8ce8-d86f9a09652e">In the history of human conflict and peace, there has never been a time when camaraderie, collective action, and International coordination had been witnessed at a scale as seen in the first half of this year while dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic. The world was truly united against one common adversary. However, as we progressed into the second half of the year, those terms lost their meaning altogether, as the world was once again plunged into a state of anarchy as nations embarked on a journey to harness socio-political and militaristic powers. Whether it be the Indo-China conflict, the United States Presidential Elections, the wave of coups destabilizing countries such as Mali, and the latest being the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict along the Line of Contact. The region of <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/nagorno-karabakh-a-region-embedded-in-ethnic-violence/">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> has long been a bone of contention between the two Middle Eastern states of Azerbaijan and Armenia.</p>



<h2 id="block-529a4de9-fdff-4d56-9f14-0cf991203e26"><strong>Background</strong> of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict</h2>



<p id="block-e85210b9-d86f-4a2c-b6f6-4f88e1cd4ce9">The region of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-the-geopolitics-of-the-conflict-between-azerbaijan-and-armenia-6663614/">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> has for several decades been constantly buffeted by the winds of political instability, which emanated from the last days of the Soviet Union. Tensions originally arose when Armenias, which constitute a majority of the population in the region demanded a complete unification with the nation of Armenia. However, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, when both Armenia and Azerbaijan were under the military-economic sway of the Soviet Union, the Armenian Parliament passed legislation, declaring the region of the Nagorno-Karabakh to be a part of Armenian territory. This was however categorically rejected by the Soviets, and led to a six-year-long war, which was only resolved in the early 1990s, by Russian intervention. In claim over the region, the Armenian authorities have cited the 1991 referendum, whereas the Azeri side has repeatedly highlighted the United Nations resolution that declares Nagorno-Karabakh, though a predominantly Armenian region, to be an integral part of Azerbaijan. As mentioned already, the region houses a majority of the Armenian population, owing to which several separatist movements have gained momentum, and have managed to declare the region as the ‘Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast’. Since the Six-Day War that recorded the killing of over 30,000 individuals, the conflict in the region has continued sporadically. However, what is unique in terms of the current conflict is the manner in which it has drawn in regional powers and has turned Nagorno-Karabakh into a region of Russian and Turkish interests.</p>



<h2 id="block-7ae616b5-19f6-41ad-ac97-98a840c6b0d7"><strong>Turkish Involvement in the Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict</strong></h2>



<p id="block-f5b24893-e31a-4bbf-8866-d3e59fce753e">In recent months, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/world/middleeast/turkey-azerbaijan-armenia-war.html">Turkish Government</a> of Recep Erdagon. has attempted to portray economic might and military prowess, through its increasing presence in the region. Through the perspective of the international community, as the conflict escalates, many actors have questioned the role played by neighbouring nations such as Turkey. However, in the current conflict, the Turkish Republic has been pinned down by allegations regarding the involvement of Syrian fighters through the Turkish backed militias. It has been ascertained that Syrians are being deployed on behalf of the Azeri army, in the form of shock troops to claw back scraps of land. The increasing deaths of Syrians in the conflict and the use of weapons produced and supplied by states like Israel has been questioned and brought under the scanner the issue that how the worsening of the decades-long conflict attracts outside regional powers to the region. Reporters have shed light on the use of Turkish, Russian, and Israeli produced weapons in the war, especially Azerbaijan’s assault on Stepanakert, the capital of the region which has included the use of cluster munitions. While on the Armenian side, the reports from international groups such as Amnesty International have confirmed the use of Russian manufactured rocket artillery systems in the bombardment of the Azeri city of Ganja. The deployment of the Syrian mercenaries has followed a pattern very similar to the conflict in Libya, where both Turkey and the Russian Federation have locked horns in a bitter battle. Turkish officials have chosen to portray their country’s expanding foreign engagements as part of the country’s promotion of its security and energy interests. Interestingly, another view that has been adopted and mainly by the critics is that Erdagon’s government has used international engagement as an excuse to divert people’s attention from domestic problems such as the crumbling economy, the problems facing the healthcare system, and the effort of the government to rally the country behind an external cause is one last attempt to shore up domestic support.</p>



<h2 id="block-d7438d57-43f5-4e76-874a-517cd804f577"><strong>Russian Stakes in the Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="499" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BN-EA832_karaba_P_20140810114711.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3694" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BN-EA832_karaba_P_20140810114711.jpg 749w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BN-EA832_karaba_P_20140810114711-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><figcaption>Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan, right, and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, left, speak to each other before talks on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia | Source: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-mediates-talks-between-armenia-azerbaijan-on-nagorno-karabakh-conflict-1407686523">WSJ</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p id="block-7fb50092-35a3-4a26-b4e8-21170440d323">As aforementioned, the Russian Federation has a long-established history with the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The first war which lasted six years was brought to an end owing to Russian intervention, effectively defining the Line of Contact between the two neighbouring nations. Russia for long has played a rather confusing and contradictory role. When it comes to Russia’s relations with Armenia, it provides military assistance through bilateral ties and Collective Security Treaty Organisations. However, this assistance for Armenia does not expand to the region of Nagorno- Karabakh, since it is an internationally recognized part of Azerbaijan. In terms of the current crises, Putin&#8217;s government has chosen to tread a fine line in terms of diplomatic relations with the erstwhile Soviet satellite states, by selling arms and providing economic assistance to both states. The Federation has given out mixed signals of its willingness to intervene in the conflict, by citing the excuse that it has met its moral obligation to aid the two states and that its jurisdiction does not extend to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Moscow has condemned Azerbaijan’s use of Turkish-backed Syrian mercenaries in the region, out of the fear of the conflict becoming the trigger for Islamist militants to establish a presence in the outer reaches of Russia. However, Russia has stepped into the conflict to bring an end to chaos once again, just like it did more than three decades ago. Unfortunately, this time introducing a mutually agreed ceasefire is not going to be a cakewalk for the Russian authorities. Even as Russia floated the idea of sending in ‘Military observers’, the suggestion wasn&#8217;t responded to by either of the two heads of states involved in the conflict. The fighting scene is the worst since the war in the early 1990s. Several international bodies warn of an emerging humanitarian crisis, which will only be aggravated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<h2 id="block-289de24e-28c5-4c88-9cf7-b6f1a7308bc7"><strong>What Next?</strong></h2>



<p id="block-7bb03299-6df2-4cf5-a812-79a2c7291496">It is crystal clear is that the current conflict can draw in regional powers especially NATO powers such as Turkey. In terms of closure to the conflict, the European Union Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, urged the two nations to carry out an immediate cessation of hostilities. While Iran, a strategic player in the region, also an ally of Armenia, offered to mediate. The region has already experienced war in the latter years of the 20th century which lasted a number of years, while on the other hand, 2016 skirmishes only lasted for a few days. Owing to such historical uncertainty it is difficult to chalk out a prediction for the near future. However, the situation may change significantly if a major power were to enter the conflict in the near future.</p>
