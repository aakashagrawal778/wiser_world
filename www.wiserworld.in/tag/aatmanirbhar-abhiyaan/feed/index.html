<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">On 12<sup>th</sup> of May, 2020, the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1623391">addressed</a> the citizens of the nation, in an attempt to motivate them to strengthen their resolve in overcoming the on-going crisis. In regard to this, he announced a <em>special economic package</em> of <strong>Rs. 20 lakh crores</strong>, constituting 10% of India’s GDP, to provide stimulus to the fight against the economic damage caused by COVID-19, and to prepare India for a tough competition in the global supply chain by increasing the efficiency of various sectors like cottage industry, MSMEs, agriculture, industrial sectors and others. The economic package will focus on <strong>land, labour, liquidity </strong>and<strong> laws</strong> and would serve as an important link in the “<strong>Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan</strong>” standing on the pillars of <strong>Economy, Infrastructure, System, Vibrant Demography </strong>and<strong> Demand</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Following the PM’s address, our Finance Minister, Dr. Nirmala Sitharaman, through a set of conferences, laid out the specifics of the package divided into 5 tranches. This article seeks to explore the details, benefits and drawbacks of the same.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Package in Details</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Overall Stimulus Provided by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>ITEM</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Allocation (in Rs. Crores)</td></tr><tr><td>PART 1</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>5,94,550</td></tr><tr><td>PART 2</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3,10,000</td></tr><tr><td>PART 3</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1,50,000</td></tr><tr><td>PARTS 4 &amp; 5</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>48,100</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SUB-TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>11,02,650</strong></td></tr><tr><td>EARLIER MEASURES INCLUDING PMGKP</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1,92,800</td></tr><tr><td>RBI MEASURES (ACTUAL)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>8,01,603</td></tr><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>SUB-TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>9,94,403</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>GRAND TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>20,97,053</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The earlier fiscal relief measures along with RBI&#8217;s measures constitute ₹9,94,403 crores, which leaves an effective amount of ₹11,02,650 crores. Thus, the immediate fiscal boost announced with such grandeur by the government is quite less than the promised amount because of the inclusion of RBI’s monetary measures, despite both being independent institutions. Direct investment by the government in the form of a boost to the aggregate demand guarantees immediate impetus to the economy, however, that might not be the case with the government’s indirect measures and RBI’s credit easing because the banks, instead of lending, might park the money back with the RBI, thus, rendering its help ineffective. Even if the banks transmit the liquidity measures from RBI to the citizens, the transmission procedure will not be smooth due to the prevailing inefficiency of monetary policy transfers.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The economic package includes a lot of measures spread over 5 tranches. However, there exists the problem of implementing those measures. A classic example is the provision of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.indifi.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-msme-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collateral-free automatic loans to MSMEs</a>. There is a high risk of non-return to banks in such cases unless the businesses end up earning high-profits amidst a global crisis, that is <strong>if the MSMEs get the required loans</strong> after overcoming the hurdles of meeting the high credit score criteria, bearing high processing costs followed by tedious procedures, and still not receiving the entire amount applied for.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Both <strong>‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan’</strong> and the <strong>‘Make In India Campaign’</strong> attempt to attract Foreign Direct Investment by laying emphasis on the <strong>promotion of local products</strong> to help with the declining job market. However, this causes a critical problem in a developing country like India which needs to depend on cost-effective imports of several products in which it does not have a comparative advantage and the domestic production of which will lead to increased manufacturing cost, thus, leading to the loss of a competitive edge in the Global Market. Although, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan does possess an advantage due to the inclusion of agriculture, which had been neglected all this while.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Although the package is very comprehensive and caters to the needs of all people, past history of failures due to the presence of corrupt bureaucracy raises the question of whether the relief package will have its desired effect. However, if the package is properly implemented and people are educated about the schemes through various drives and trained to utilize the benefits available to them, then there exists the possibility of success of the package through economic upliftment of the nation.</p>
