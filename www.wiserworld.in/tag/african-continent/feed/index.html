										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">The economic lagging of Africa in the global market can be easily seen through the major gap between its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/africa-global-growth-economics-worldwide-gdp/">contribution </a>to the world&#8217;s population (17%) and the world&#8217;s GDP (3%). The failure to optimally use the continent&#8217;s existing resources contributes to the gap. Unless the massive growth opportunities and risks involved are explored thoroughly, Africa will never be able to realize its true potential.</p>



<h3><strong>Past Challenges</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The economic and social exploitation of the continent&#8217;s resources for decades along with horrendous violence and poor administration by corrupt leaders leading to widespread poverty and untimely deaths, which could have been prevented, has greatly contributed to its present economic scenario of Africa. Africa has witnessed one of the biggest cruelties of humanity, <strong>slavery. </strong>African slaves were supplied to American plantations which not only led to the loss of welfare due to denial of basic <strong>Human Rights</strong> but also hindered progress due to scarcity of labour in Africa. The <strong>anti-slave legislation</strong> solved the problem of scarcity and brought about a major change in the continent that led to the expansion of tropical agriculture in the economy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">However, that did not guarantee good days for Africa because, soon, they came under Colonial Control. The colonizers plundered their resources, worked them to death, impeded growth and development, and projected Africa as an economically weak continent in the global economy. They employed Africa&#8217;s necessary resources in the production and export of cheap primary commodities and raw materials only, which forced them to import the expensive manufactured goods which caused <strong>unequal trade transactions </strong>and greatly increased the trade deficits. The colonial rule has had serious long-term consequences on the economy of Africa and has greatly contributed to the underdevelopment of the continent.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Africa&#8217;s commendable growth potential is evident from the way it has bounced back from decades of torture and exploitation and maintained a somewhat average growth rate of 5% since 2000 in the Sub-Saharan region. This shows that Africa has the capability to increase and sustain its growth despite facing adverse conditions.</p>



<h3><strong>Present Scenario Due to the Pandemic </strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Despite not achieving the desired growth in 2019, forecasters were hopeful about the acceleration of growth at a stable rate, with an increase to 3.9% in 2020. However, due to the sudden onset of the pandemic, all prior forecasts have been rendered futile. New predictions state a sharp contraction in the Real GDP by 1.7% in 2020, indicating a 5.6% fall from the previous forecasts. These predictions are valid only for the short-term impact of the virus. If it were to last beyond the first quarter of 2020, then GDP would contract by 3.4%, i.e., a 7.3% fall from the previous predictions. This fall in GDP is accompanied by a 5% sharp rise in headline inflation due to supply-chain disruptions, thus, putting the economy in a state of <strong>stagflation. </strong>However, there is scope for the internal stability of the inflation rate due to immense fall in aggregate demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015156.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2683" width="346" height="378" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015156.png 623w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015156-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></figure></div>
</div>
</div>



<h4><strong>Challenges Being Faced</strong></h4>



<h5>Effect on Fiscal Deficits</h5>



<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">The pandemic will lead to a great cyclical increase in fiscal deficits in Africa. It will happen in a two-fold process of decreasing government revenues and increasing fiscal expenditures to boost demand in the economy. In 2020, the deficits have been <a href="https://www.afdb.org/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https://www.afdb.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/afdb20-04_aeo_supplement_full_report_for_web_0705.pdf">predicted </a>to rise to 8% &#8211; 9% of the GDP, depending on the severity of the situation.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">From the pandemics and other crises of the past, it has been noted that government revenues fall more rapidly than economic activity. Situations are more likely to worsen and be volatile to COVID-19 shocks due to the ineptitude of the administration in successfully implementing proper policy reforms to ensure smooth flow of government revenue.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015606.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2684" width="359" height="396" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015606.png 615w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-09-015606-271x300.png 271w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></figure></div>
</div>
</div>



<h5>Effect on Poverty</h5>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If there is a continuation of the prevailing trends, Africa will not be able to do away with extreme poverty by 2030, as planned before.&nbsp; Taking into account the current scenario, there have been estimations that poverty will only fall to 24.7% in 2030 from 33.4% in 2018, which is still way above the 3%<strong> Sustainable Development Goal Target. </strong>Figures in the <strong>Economic Outlook of Africa (2020)</strong> indicate that the number of poor people will merely fall by 8 million, from 429.1 million in 2018 to 421.2 million in 2030. Only North Africa is expected to somewhat meet the 3% target by 2030.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">However, the process of eradication can be sped-up by accelerating growth and development in the continent and taking measures to increase the social well-being of the people. Aggregate personal consumption needs a massive boost, of about 10% per annum, to help achieve the target by 2030.<strong> </strong>If these measures are not implemented properly then poverty eradication will remain a distant unachievable dream for the continent.</p>



<h5>Other Challenges</h5>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are other challenges being faced by Africa at the moment like increases in the debt burdens and fall in remittances and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Several countries in Africa have high debt-to-GDP ratios which are projected to drastically increase in the onset of COVID-19 and possess the risk of transforming to a sovereign debt crisis if not dealt with properly. In addition to it, remittances and FDI which constitute a dominant financial flow to Africa have been falling during the pandemic. This poses serious threats to the African economy and makes it vulnerable to economic instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Policies to Ensure Stability </strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/african-economic-outlook-2020">African Economic Outlook</a> (2020) suggests a few actionable policies to not only improve the quality of growth in Africa but also combat the impact of the pandemic. They are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>The government should ease the main constraints to productivity like poor infrastructure, uneducated and unskilled labour, poor administration, and others. Relaxing these constraints through adequate policy will guarantee growth revival.</li><li>Governments across the continent should take adequate measures to not only stop the spread of the coronavirus but also economic stability by formulating and implementing a variety of combined fiscal and monetary policies.</li><li>The fiscal and monetary policies should work hand-in-hand to collectively help in the revival of the economy. The fiscal policy should keep the debt buildup in check and provide a massive boost to aggregate demand and the monetary policy should work towards maintaining a stable inflation rate and minimizing exchange rate fluctuations.&nbsp;</li><li>There must be a shift from low-productivity informal sectors to high-productivity formal sectors which would help utilize the untapped resources of the economy.</li><li>Despite the moderate growth of Africa over the past few decades, the quality of growth has been far from inclusive. Only a combination of rigid structural reforms by policymakers can accelerate Africa’s growth and improve its quality and inclusiveness.&nbsp;</li><li>Even if there is reduced scope for increased gains, policymakers should implement measures to sustain the gains already achieved in the past few years including macroeconomic stability, minimum fluctuations in exchange rates, and others.</li><li>The government should increase the welfare of the people amidst the pandemic by providing proper healthcare benefits to labourers in the form of paid sick leaves and ensure income safety to those sick or quarantined and ensure job security to all who are suffering to check the increase of unemployment.</li><li>The government should also facilitate <strong>Universal access </strong>to financed health services for everyone irrespective of their sector or employment status.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>The Global Health Security (GHS) Index</strong> shows that 33 African countries are inadequately equipped to deal with the threats of the pandemic from a clinical perspective. However, Africa might stand a chance to stay strong in this adversity if proper arrangements can be made for rampant testing across the continent at affordable costs.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The future conditions of the economy depend on the competency of the governments to deal with the issue at hand. If the economies can uphold their resilience at this time, there is hope for a speedy revival and acceleration of the growth of Africa. This resilience can be maintained via effective structural reforms, to keep high debts and deficits in check, and minimal vulnerability, in the form of external reserves, to be able to finance imported advanced medical consumables and to make them available to the public. Thus, there has emerged an urgent need for policymakers to implement drastic reforms to strengthen resilience to be able to withstand shocks at all levels, be it macroeconomic, microeconomic or household levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Africa’s slow progress can be a cause of concern for prospective investors. However, investing in the emerging sectors will long-term benefits to those willing to wait. Strong demographics, rising sectors and abundant resources are some of the long-term growth opportunities. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/BLS18234_BRO_book_006.1_CH5.pdf">Strive Masiyiwa</a>, chairman of the pan-African company Econet Group, remarked: “Africa is a continent with extraordinary challenges, and it’s a copout just to wait for governments to deal with them. If you see a problem, then think about how you can solve a piece of it”. There are several investment opportunities for those who want to bring about a positive change in the conditions of the continent while achieving long term yields from the same. According to <strong><a href="https://www.rmb.co.za/files/pdf/Where_to_Invest_in_Africa_2020.pdf">RMB Investment Attractiveness Rankings</a>, </strong>the best countries to invest in are <strong>Egypt, Morocco, </strong>and <strong>South Africa. </strong>This article provides insight into those sectors that have emerged as attractive investment opportunities in recent times.</p>



<h3><strong>Agriculture</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Agriculture is one of the top sectors in Africa with immense growth potential. The sector contributes to over <a href="https://www.rmb.co.za/files/pdf/Where_to_Invest_in_Africa_2020.pdf">15% of Africa&#8217;s GDP </a>and has shown a good growth rate due to prior government policies that prioritise the sector to retain its sustainability and competitiveness. The top-earning agricultural products are coffee, cocoa, maize and wheat with Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Uganda as the top producers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07586eb3b2dda382c780b322c44894ba.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2358" width="549" height="352" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07586eb3b2dda382c780b322c44894ba.png 624w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07586eb3b2dda382c780b322c44894ba-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Large areas of arable land, increasing use of technology, massive youth dividend, increasing government support and a large demand base make agriculture an <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/701a29a9-0740-400c-bb86-3d64e5d0a11a/Africa+CEO+Forum+Report_FIN3_Web-lores.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=m9z19ct">attractive sector for investment</a> despite the problem of erratic rainfall pattern in some places.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">By the year 2050, it has been predicted that Africa&#8217;s population will almost double with a growth rate of 2.7% per annum. To meet the growing needs of the population, substantial investment from its global peers is absolutely necessary. That will also help the sector to grow and enhance its status as a global competitor, help in economic diversification and also mitigate the prominent problems of undernourishment, poverty and hunger that exist in the region.</p>



<h3><strong>Manufacturing Sector</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Africa possesses an abundance of raw materials that can be easily turned to manufactured products for greater reliance on local products and increased exports of the same. The top three manufacturers in Africa are Egypt, South Africa and Morocco.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The growth of manufacturing can greatly drive economic growth and development in Africa. However, the sector faces challenges like lack of skilled-workforce, infrastructure gaps including low power supply and inadequate regulatory measures to address the prominent challenges. The import to export ratio of manufactured products in Africa is very high as Africa mostly exports unprocessed commodities. The growing manufacturing sector is making great advances in this aspect. It has already increased the total export goods from 18.7% in 2012 to 35.6% in 2017 and caused a significant decrease in imports implying greater importance to domestically manufactured products.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There has also been a shift in the focus of FDI projects from the dominant extractive industry to consumer-facing industries like retail, technology, media, etc. This trend is expected to continue in the near future.</p>



<h3><strong>Retail Sector</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The African Development Bank is expecting the current <a href="https://www.rmb.co.za/files/pdf/Where_to_Invest_in_Africa_2020.pdf">350-million-strong</a> middle class to grow to under one billion by 2040. The growing middle-class demography is contributing to the growth and modernization of the retail sector which is greatly devoid of supply competition and requires investment to meet the growing consumer base. The <strong>market for essential goods </strong>constitutes the majority of consumer spending owing to the low-income levels in the economy and as the income-level status is not expected to undergo a drastic change in the recent future, the comparatively smaller market for luxury products will have a low growth rate.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As a large amount of consumer spending in Africa taking place in informal markets, due to the absence of prominent formal retail presence, is unaccounted for, Africa is projected as an economy with low household retail-spending despite that not being the case.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">“The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Africas-consumer-market-potential.pdf">Brookings Institute’s latest analysis</a> on trends of the African consumer market shows that consumer expenditure has grown at a compound annual rate of 3.9% since 2010 and reached US$1.4 trillion in 2015. This figure is expected to increase to US$2.5 trillion by 2030.”</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are several cyclical challenges related to the retail sector, like low GDP growth, high inflation, dwindling credit extension. The challenges can be used as opportunities to enhance the growth of the sector by focusing on the development of the retail infrastructure and modern logistics spaces to satiate the demand for high-quality space from retailers looking to expand in Africa.</p>



<h3><strong>Finance</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Finance is one of the top sectors in Africa which regulates the funding of all the other sectors. Financial innovation guarantees the diversification of banking sector services and facilitates the incorporation of capital market instruments to reduce investment risk.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Rwanda, The Gambia and Senegal have shown massive progress in<a href="https://www.rmb.co.za/landing/where-to-invest-in-africa"> financial system rankings</a>. However, there has been an overall decline in Africa&#8217;s global financial standing from 2017 &#8211; 2018 due to a fall in the pace of reform of this sector.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The impact investing industry has shown substantial growth and is quite relevant as several countries in Africa lie below the global average score for Human Development (0.8) with declining levels of official assistance. The industry has made an abundant impact across a wide range of sectors like Healthcare, Agriculture, Housing, Education and others. This provides ample opportunities for investment in several initiatives which will reap both financial and environmental returns.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Some of the prominent threats to this sector include underdeveloped market infrastructure due to limited funding, difficulty in gathering viable investment to meet financial and social targets, limited capital supply, unclear regulatory environment, inconsistent impact-measures and so on. These might prove to be a disincentive to many and hinder their investments. However, a far-sighted investor might implement innovative measures to meet the pending gaps and turn these challenges into opportunities to optimise social and environmental investments.</p>



<h3><strong>Infrastructure</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Infrastructural inadequacy causes a huge hindrance to investment and growth in all sectors of Africa. There is a wide gap between the infrastructure needs of the continent and the amount being spent on fulfilling the need. There is an urgent need to bridge the gap through sufficient investment to meet the growing needs of Africa.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExternalFinanciers-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2364" width="569" height="402" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExternalFinanciers-3.jpg 750w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExternalFinanciers-3-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /><figcaption><em><a href="https://www.tralac.org/news/article/6815-infrastructure-financing-trends-in-africa-2013-report.html">External Financiers of Africa’s infrastructure</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In countries like East Africa, Ethiopia and Tanzania, infrastructure investments in the form of new roads, energy support, transportation networks and others have led to guaranteed growth and transformation of the prevailing sectors. Construction has been primarily responsible for high <a href="https://www.rmb.co.za/landing/where-to-invest-in-africa">economic expansion in Egypt</a>. Infrastructural developments lead to employment generation via contractors, boosting aggregate demand. Investment in infrastructure by foreign players can prove to be very beneficial as it would provide the required sophistication to the local industry by supplying goods needed for large projects.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Real estate has evolved significantly, providing higher returns on investments, thus, becoming increasingly attractive to potential investors. Despite having good growth potential, real estate has certain risks attached to it like <strong>complex legal considerations, such as property ownership rights, social instability resulting from inequality, </strong>and others. However, the growth drivers like sustained high demand driven by urbanisation, improved capital regulation, technological advancements in banking leading to a boost in investment rates, and expected GDP growth supporting the demand for housing easily overshadow the challenges.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For many years, Africa’s growth potential has been understated and misunderstood. It has been treated as a non-friendly investment destination due to the several challenges posed. However, there has been a worldwide lack of understanding of the ease of converting the insurmountable challenges to opportunities. Africa’s growing population and the prevailing problem of excess demand need to be met via increased investment and innovation which will, in turn, lead to increased employment, decreased poverty and increased infrastructural development. Thus, despite Africa’s slowing global growth, if the prevailing challenges are addressed adequately, growth is inevitable.</p>
