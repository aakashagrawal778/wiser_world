										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">The strategic and economic ties between India and Central Asia can be traced back to the era of the Silk Road, which facilitated the flux of ideas in the Asian region. At the time, India’s territories, especially that of the Kushan Empire, reached up to the frontiers of the Central Asian plateau. This geographic relationship continued further until the 16th century when the Mughal reign had begun in India. According to <a href="https://mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Uzbekistan_Jan_2017.pdf">historical research</a>, economically, not only did Central Asian cities – such as Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara – play an important role in the Silk Road connecting India with China and Europe, but also Indian merchants based in the region formed an integral part of the local economies. Furthermore, the cultural relationship was extended on other aspects as well. This can be seen in the spread of Buddhism from the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia and the ideas of Sufism reaching India therefrom.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Historical Context</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://carnegieindia.org/2019/12/01/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576">Observations</a> have shown that with the onset of the Age of Discovery in Europe, increased interest of Russia and China in Central Asia somewhat led to the breaking away of India’s connections with the region. Even after Independence, India’s foreign policy majorly focused on its immediate neighbours, or solidarity-based relations with the African countries, or even robust economic ties with Russia &#8212; but, the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent and the distancing of the region geographically did play a role in the deterioration of the relations with the region from India.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Further, in the post-Cold War era, after the Soviet Union split Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the 1990s, India took upon the task of developing its relations with the resource-rich region while also undertaking its own domestic economic reforms of bringing about liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation. Former Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited four out of the five republics – Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 1993, followed by Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan in 1995. In addition to the collective values that India shared with the countries, collective development and economic growth, as well as formulating approached to combating common threats such as terrorism, religious extremism, and crime that these nations shared with India. A few <a href="https://carnegieindia.org/2019/12/01/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576">experts</a> also believe that the stage which was set by these conversations was even reflected in India’s Look North policy of recent times.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Despite the historical links with the Central Asian Economies and India moving quickly to establish diplomatic ties with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan after their emergence as independent countries almost three decades ago, trade has not grown beyond $2 billion, with them. In recent years, foreign-affairs analysts have begun <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-and-china-in-central-asia-understanding-the-new-rivalry-in-the-heart-of-eurasia-61473/#_edn6">observing</a> what they call the “New Great Game” in Central Asia &#8212; Russia, the US, European Union (EU), China, Turkey, Iran and India are all trying to assert their power and hegemony in the region. Not only does the region provide for a large market, but it also has prospects for developing hydropower, fossil fuel resources, and other lucrative prospects. According to <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-and-china-in-central-asia-understanding-the-new-rivalry-in-the-heart-of-eurasia-61473/#_edn3">experts</a>, India, for its part, has so far chosen to take the ‘constructivist’ approach. This entails a strategy of, interests are not solely based on economic or strategic benefits but attempt to involve an intersectional and even culture-oriented involvement.</p>



<h3><strong>Current Developments</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India’s continued interest in Central Asia can be attributed to the geopolitical relevance of the region due to three factors &#8212; Chinese presence and influx in the region through its expansionist infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a continued historical context of Russia’s dominance in the region, and the overall regional security dynamic. Keeping these in mind, India had unveiled its Connect Central Asia Policy in Bishkek in 2012 in order to draw attention to the expansion of the region’s economic interests in congruence with India’s plans of integrating its external neighbourhood.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The lack of connectivity of India with the region of Central Asia has been a long withstanding issue in this context. For instance, the long-delayed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, backed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), was first proposed in the mid-1990s and all four actors officially signed an intergovernmental agreement in 2010. But, since then, the project has been stalled due to the status of Afghanistan and mistrust between India and Pakistan.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">To combat this connectivity gap, India has undertaken positive action in the past as well quite recently. India, Iran and Russia signed the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) agreement which aimed to offer connectivity between India and Central Asia through Iran. As is noted by this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://carnegieindia.org/2019/12/01/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576" target="_blank">resource</a>, while the INSTC is routed via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port, India has also explored the possibility of connecting with Central Asia via Iran’s Chabahar port and thereafter overland corridors passing through Afghanistan. The importance bestowed by India to the Chabahar port, despite the uncertainties which the US-Iran tensions bring to the conversation, can be accorded by the budgetary allocation to the project, which is amounting to INR 1 Billion in 2020-21 announcement.</p>



<h3><strong>Way Forward</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since China has been able to leverage its geography, finances and population to ensure that its projects can contribute toward making its dream of a new and improved Silk Road a reality, India is also committed to expanding the scope of its economic relations with the region. India has immense potential in developing small and medium scale industries in the region which is presently being provided through India’s program of ITEC (Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation). The ITEC programme covers information technology, management, journalism, diplomacy, entrepreneurship, and banking. New Delhi also signed the Strategic Partnership Agreements (SPA) with three of the five nations of the Central Asian Economies &#8212; Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan &#8212; in order to stimulate defence cooperation and deepen trade relations.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As a <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3984235">report </a>in a Russian newspaper observed, “Indian presence in the region should balance the growing Chinese influence and prevent it from becoming the region of Beijing’s undivided dominance.” This idea can be brought to effect by India by leveraging its membership at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India and the Central Asian Economies can prioritize energy, pharmaceuticals, automotive, agro-processing, education, urban infrastructure and transport, civil aviation, IT and tourism sectors to strengthen economic links. The Central Asian economies and India have had a long history of association which can be efficiently revived to mutual benefit by the means of strategic and economic cooperation and connectivity, both notions that can be leveraged by the stakeholders in a post-pandemic world.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Japan, an island country situated in East Asia, is known worldwide for its remarkable Japanese culture, which is perhaps one of the most unique and vibrant cultures to have ever prospered in the world. Often called the <strong>Land of the Rising Sun</strong>, the country is heavily associated with cherry blossom trees (Sakura), anime and manga, Sushi and Ramen, tea ceremonies, etc, pictures of which are often displayed in Japan tourism ads.</p>



<h3><strong>KYOTO – THE CULTURAL CENTRE</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While the rich culture of Japan is prevalent throughout the entire nation, the city of Kyoto in the southwest of the country is regarded as the cultural centre, by the Japanese and foreigners alike, perhaps owing to its historical roots. Kyoto was the capital of the country until the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and therefore people often perceive it as the birthplace of the Japanese culture. Home to about 2000 temples and shrines along with imperial palaces, and other ancient buildings, it was within this city that several distinct cultural institutions of Japan, like, <strong>tea ceremony (cha-no-yu)</strong> and <strong>flower</strong> <strong>arranging (ikebana)</strong>,<strong> the theatrical arts of Noh</strong>,<strong> Kabuki </strong>and <strong>traditional dance</strong>, were initiated and spread to other parts of the country. Kyoto also has housed masterpieces of calligraphy, sculpting, painting and architecture. The population in Kyoto still remains involved in such activities, creating masterpieces that are deemed as national treasures, conducting tea ceremonies, and having an active theatrical life with annual processions by Noh performers, etc. The three festivals that the citizens celebrate in great grandeur and pride are <strong>Aoi </strong>in May, <strong>Gion</strong> in July and <strong>Jidai</strong> in October.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>Jidai Festival</em></p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Japanese population along with the whole world, has embraced the culture of Kyoto, which can be implied by the recent popularity of the phrase, <strong>“Sekai no Kyoto”</strong> (The World’s Kyoto). The popular tourist destinations like the many number of Shrines and temples (Fushimi Inari Shrine, Gingaku – Ji Temple, Kinkaku – Ji temple, etc ), the Arashiyama Bamboo grove, and others such as Gion and Pont-cho street attract tourists from all over the world, and even the native Japanese who try to go to the city atleast once in their lives.</p>



<h3><strong>RELIGION – Buddhism and Shintoism</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Japan has seen the growth of two major religions, i.e, Buddhism which was brought about by foreign forces and the native religion of Shintoism, both of which have peacefully co-existed. However, the &nbsp;division between followers of Buddhism and Shintoism is far from watertight, as most often, those Japanese who follow Buddhism, sometimes also declare themselves as followers of Shinto. Therefore, any claims of the population being divided solely into Buddhists and Shintos do not hold.</p>



<h4><strong>Shintoism</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>Fushimi Inari-taisha</em></p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Shinto, i.e, the way of the Gods (Kami) is the oldest religion in Japan and possibly the most followed, as evidence suggests that about 80% of the Japanese identify themselves as followers of Shinto. There are no historical evidences that suggest the identity of the founder of the religion, and a lack of sacred texts and any sort of formalized teachings, indicate the fact that unlike Buddhism, it’s not an organized religion. The cornerstone of Shintoism is the belief in <a href="https://thetruejapan.com/shinto-a-look-into-the-religion-of-japan/">Kami</a>, i.e, the spiritual elements of nature that exist in waterways, trees, mountains, and geographical regions. &nbsp;The only foundation of the religion in conclusion is therefore, reverence of peace and harmony, respect for all elements of nature and the belief that being in nature means a closer access to Kami.</p>



<h4><strong>How has Buddhism influenced Japanese culture?</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:12px"><em>The Great Buddha (Daibutsu) at Kōtoku-in, Kamakura, in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan</em></p>



<p>Buddhism which officially came to Japan around 525 BC, has been able to acquire a large following in the country, with about 90 million of the population identifying themselves as Buddhists. While the religion faced a certain conflict between pro-Buddhist and anti-Buddhism factions, it was successful in establishing its foundations in Japan and subsequently changed the political structure, technological fields and brought in a myriad of sophisticated cultural practices like dance, music, a new writing system and also Buddhist art, that have undoubtedly had a greater impact on the Japanese culture as a whole.</p>



<h3><strong>‘<em>Matsuri</em>’ – THE CULTURAL FESTIVALS OF JAPAN</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A very important and lively aspect of Japanese culture, is the many number of ‘<strong>matsuri’</strong> or the cultural festivals, which bring in cheerful spirits for the native population, who often enjoy the festivities wearing colourful and mostly, traditional clothes and getting involved in the activities the festivals are known for. Research suggests that Japan witnesses as many as 200-300 festivals in a year, all of which are big, fun and crowded events, and are deeply entrenched within the Japanese Culture.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These festivals which occur over the course of a year, differ greatly in terms of the season in which they occur.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>SUMMER</strong>: The festivals in summer are known worldwide for their use of fireworks or what the Japanese call, <strong>Hanabi</strong>. These fireworks light up the sky in bright colours and the people often dressed in their Yukatas and Kimonos,&nbsp; gather in large numbers to watch the show.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>SPRING</strong>: In Spring, the Cherry blossoms or Sakura trees turn pink which in itself is a site of majestic beauty. The spring festivals are centered around these trees, where people from different regions come and enjoy activities under the cherry blossoms either in a park, a castle, etc. The <strong>Hirosaki Cherry Blossom</strong> <strong>Festival</strong> is perhaps one of the most famous of such festivals that are conducted in Japan.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>WINTER AND FALL</strong>: Besides Summer and Spring, cultural festivals of unique natures are also practiced in Winters and Fall. In winter, for instance, the <strong>Sapporo Snow Festival </strong>and <strong>Nozawa festival </strong>attract thousands of visitors and so does the <strong>Fujiwara Autumn Festival</strong> in fall.</p>

<h3><strong>What role have ANIME and MANGA played in Japanese culture? &nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Anime</strong>, as the name suggests, is Japanese animation which is either hand-drawn or computer-animated. The diverse fan base of Anime, which is worldwide,is perhaps because of it’s very distinct characteristics that distinguish it from animation produced in any other parts of the world. <strong>Manga</strong>, on the other hand, are more like Japanese comics or Graphic novels which are read from right to left, while western comics can only be read left to right. Often, those mangas which are able to acquire a large fan base, like Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Haikyu, etc, are converted into anime. Both Anime and Manga, over the years have become a very crucial aspect of Japanese culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <strong>unconventionality </strong>associated with anime and manga, is perhaps a contributor to it’s popularity among adults, and not just kids. These stories that are available in all genres like action, romance, slice of life, rom-com, supernatural, horror, etc, break the notion that anime is meant only for kids. The fan base remain hooked on each episode or chapter, due to the unpredictability of what might happen next.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In Japan, anime and Manga, has become a way of life for <strong>‘Otakus’</strong> (which however is an offensive word for the Japanese) a term used for those hardcore fans of these elements, to the extent that they give up their social lives and withdraw into their homes watching anime and playing video games. The emotional attachment to these forms of entertainment becomes evident when numerous instances of funerals held for anime characters come into light. But anime in Japan is not only limited to the private sphere. It’s presence is abundant everywhere, on trains, buses, advertisements, etc. Moreover, anime and manga also provide a deep insight into Japanese culture, in both covert and overt ways. Most animes have episodes dedicated to the cultural festivals, fireworks, cherry blossoms, otaku culture, Japanese way of living, tea ceremonies and so on. The town of <strong>Akihabara</strong> near Tokyo, is believed to be the Anime centre, the streets of which are lined with numerous anime shops selling anime merchandise of various kinds. There are also many themed cafes like maid and butler cafes, which attract a lot of tourists. Even outside Akihabara, it is not uncommon to find many huge or life-size statues that give tribute to anime characters and their creators. Anime themed parks, which are a sight of awe for tourists as well as the natives are also abundant in Japan, the most famous of them being the Naruto theme park, Attack on Titans theme park, etc. Often, streets of Japan are also lined with cosplayers, impersonating characters from famous animes. In fact, cosplaying is also an important part of Japanese culture, which has immense importance, as evident by the numerous cosplay competitions held throughout the nation. Anime conventions are also likely events in Japan which are attended by Anime fans from Japan and all over the world.</p>



<h3><strong>TRADITIONAL ARCHITECTURE, CUISINE AND ATTIRE</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Traditional Japanese Architecture is attributed to a distinct aesthetic, that can be attributed to some unique characteristics used in the making of these homes. The dominant feature of traditional Japanese homes is <strong>wood</strong>, that is preferred in the making of the house over other materials such as stone, perhaps owing to the unpredictability brought about by earthquakes. Wood is respected by the Japanese to the extent that the wood in homes remain in their natural forms and is not concealed by paint. The doors in these houses are fusuma, or sliding doors while the windows are movable screens (shoji). The floors in Japanese houses are covered with tatami mats, made with straw, that along with the wood provides a distinct smell to the traditional Japanese houses. Outside the houses, are what may be called verandahs, which are a wooden extension to the house, which are often elevated from the ground, sometimes covered with shutters.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Japanese cuisine basically comprises of regional and traditional foods, and primarily focuses on combining <strong>steamed rice (gohan</strong>) which is their staple with one or more main and side dishes and <strong>miso soup </strong>or pickles. While this typically describes the traditional meal, there are also many other variants of food that the Japanese are known for like, <strong>Sushi, Ramen, tempura, Curry rice, Yakitori</strong>, etc.</p>

Other pieces of traditional Japanese clothing include <strong>Haori, Jinbei, Hakama</strong>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>INDIA AND JAPAN – THE CULTURAL TIES</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:12px"></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India and Japan have continued to maintain strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Japan_relations#Cultural">cultural ties</a>, ever since the arrival of Buddhism in Japan, from India. The countries have often engaged in mutual cultural exchanges and also follow some similar cultural traditions and ideas along with Buddhism, like the commitment to Democracy, pluralism, open societies, tolerance, etc. The <strong><a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/events/namaste-india/">Namaste India Festival</a></strong> which is held in Tokyo every year is aimed at realizing the agreement between the two countries about holding cultural festivals, on 2007, which marked the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Indo-Japan cultural agreement. These festivals aim at bringing an insight of each country’s culture, that includes food, music, souvenirs, clothes, etc, to the other.</p>
