										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The porn industry in India is one such industry that is not talked about by anyone, although it happens to be a major part of our nation. Furthermore, It&#8217;s unobscured to anyone that the porn industry drives the demand for the Human trafficking network. With the advancements made in the field of mass media in our daily life, primarily the internet, porn and porn industry has become an integral part of people’s lives. Today, people get access to it through the internet. In fact, they can access it with only a click. </p>



<p>The porn industry has become more popular with the advent of the internet and the industry has been fishing in a lot of money. It is now readily available on the internet. Many stores also sell takeaway DVDs at a very high price. This has resulted in a highly profitable industry. The display of such adult content on television or the internet is looked down upon in society. This kind of duplicity has been common in India. In fact, porn is also blamed for the rising count of rapes in India.</p>



<p>According to a 2011 IMRB Survey, one out of every five mobile users in India uses their 3G internet for accessing porn. In fact, over 47 percent of students discuss porn every day, according to a public school survey by Max Hospital in Delhi. These numbers speak volumes about how much the porn industry impacts the lives of people.</p>



<p>Over the years, the education of children regarding sex has always been held as being necessary. However, what people don’t talk about is the toll it takes on certain women and children who end up being the victims of human trafficking. According to Miss Rawal, who is a professional in Delhi said, “Porn belittles women more than anything in the world. Treating females purely as an object for personal sexual satisfaction is all porn ever evinces. I hope it is declared illicit at least in Indian society.”</p>



<h2><strong>How Porn and Human Trafficking are Related?</strong></h2>



<p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/what-is-human-trafficking.html">defines </a>human trafficking as any situation where an individual is forced, coerced, abducted, deceived, or abused. If any of these qualifiers are present, the situation will be considered human trafficking. Human trafficking takes place on many fronts in the porn industry; although due to the way in which porn is produced and distributed, it can be extremely hard to identify the presence of such trafficking along with its source.</p>



<p>Survivors of sex trafficking are often subjected to many kinds of abuses and more than one form of exploitation. In order to control it, traffickers take incriminating photos of their victims to their family members to shame them more. They also attempt to sell the content by uploading it to mainstream porn sites. In addition, victims are also exploited through prostitution.</p>



<p>In many other cases, victims are exploited solely for the purpose of producing pornographic content.&nbsp; Many NGOs have been responsible for finding victims of trafficking. These missions have also provided evidence of the existence of such heinous acts. In a very recent rescue known as <a href="https://pages.theexodusroad.com/rescue-operations?_fs=81a4d6af-6e01-4e7c-b890-2c395cc8a93e">Operation SCOPE</a>, investigators have seen this type of trafficking first-hand, and they have managed to provide the police with evidence of pornographic content being sold by traffickers.</p>



<p>In the mainstream porn entertainment industry as well, the recruitment and employment of actors have been the result of deception, threats, and drug abuse.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/report/iwf-2019-annual-report-zero-tolerance">research</a> conducted by the Internet Watch Foundation, 95 percent of the nearly 133,000 URLs assessed were hosted on platforms that allow people to create and upload porn.</p>



<p>If a pornographic video of a survivor or victim of trafficking is uploaded to any website, both the uploader and the website profit from it, even though the content is freely available. According to recently collected data, 90 percent of the free porn websites and nearly 100 percent of porn websites that require payment get the content from outside sources. Even if the users are able to upload any sort of porn content for free, the website owners will be able to profit just from the traffic flow that is generated to the website.</p>



<p>The line between legal pornography and human trafficking is very different from each other. There is a thin line between them which gets complicated. Most of the popular porn sites today have been seen featuring illegal content. They even go as far as featuring videos of rape victims.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://blog.theexodusroad.com/porn-and-human-trafficking-the-facts-you-need-to-know">campaign</a> was launched against Pornhub, which happens to be the largest porn website in the world. Many have joined this movement and advocated that the website be shut down. Pornhub features many cases of human trafficking, including the rape of a 14-year-old girl. They also display child sexual abuse.</p>



<p>Globally, the porn industry is a $97 billion industry where the US accounts for 12 billion of it. In 2017, the International Association of Internet Hotlines  (INHOPE) was able to trace certain online child sexual abuse material to<a href="https://www.inhope.org/media/pages/articles/annual-reports/3740021212-1573738999/inhope-annual-report-2017.pdf"> </a>over 70 countries in the same year and more than 60 countries in the year 2018. Top porn entertainment companies, like Pornhub, advertised and received a huge amount of content from countries all over the world. Every year, Pornhub manages to release a report that shows the statistics from the top 20 countries. Human trafficking in the porn industry is something that cannot just be isolated to just one location. Sadly, pornography of trafficking survivors have been spread all over the world and are available with only a click.</p>



<p>Human trafficking in the porn industry is very different from the prostitution industry. It is something that is happening every day, but it is not dealt with in a proper way. There are many NGOs that work to find and help such victims of human trafficking. The millions of people who are fighting for the closing of the Pornhub website are also trying to help in their own way. Many women and children are tortured for this. The porn industry isn’t kind to any actors nor are the human traffickers. However, with the help of some NGOs, we can hope to reduce this kind of trafficking.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Mental health has been extensively explored by popular media and oftentimes they have their own take on mental illnesses.&nbsp; Conforming to the codes of psychological thriller and “detective story” narratives, films portraying Dissociative Identity Disorder has become a popular and enduring genre. While some movies may successfully highlight mental health conditions, others may reinforce misconceptions, stigmas and stereotypes such as the notion that people with D.I.D are violent and harmful. &nbsp; Although movies like “Split”, “Sybil’ and the recent Amazon Prime show – “Breathe: Into the Shadows” has received a lot of praises and criticisms for their portrayal of D.I.D in a certain manner, in reality, Dissociative Identity Disorder is much deeper and intricate that all of this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>KIM NOBLE : AN ARTIST DIVIDED</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>A lot of people are very frightened of us until they meet us</em>”</p><cite>~ Kim Noble</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="http://www.kimnobleartist.com/about.html">Kim Noble</a> is a 59-year-old mother who lives in south London with her teenage daughter Aimee, two dogs and more than 20 separate personalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Dawn</strong> is stuck in 1997, searching for her daughter Sky, who she believes was taken away.</p>



<p><strong>Bonny</strong> had the strength to fight for her child through the courts.</p>



<p><strong>Ken</strong> is a depressed gay man of 21.</p>



<p><strong>Abi </strong>has loneliness in her life.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Ria Pratt</strong> is 12 or 13, and is thought to have been abused.</p>



<p><strong>Judy</strong> is a 15-year-old&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anorexia">anorexic</a> and bulimic, and is often a bit cheeky, but is very good at painting.</p>



<p><strong>Patricia</strong>, in her 50&#8217;s, is strict and sensible and is the narrator of an intriguing new book called “All of Me.” She is the most consistent personality of Kim.</p>



<p>While all these personalities appear independent, each is a part of Kim Noble, whose main personality is split into several parts, each having an amnesic barrier between them. Her other alter egos include <strong>Salome the devout Catholic, a little boy who speaks only Latin, an elective mute, a sensible Hayley, and a handful of children &#8220;frozen&#8221; in time</strong>. While many of the alters are unaware of it, some of the alters know that Kim has Dissociative Identity Disorder or D.I.D—the preferred term for Split Personality Disorder or what used to be called Multiple Personality Disorder.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2554" width="744" height="402" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png 896w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-300x162.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /><figcaption>Kim Noble with her Art pieces</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>From the age of 14, Kim spent twenty years in and out of psychiatric hospitals because of being diagnosed with everything from schizophrenia to depression, hysterical amnesia, anorexia and bulimia. Finally, she met Dr Valerie Sinason and Dr Rob Hale at the Tavistock and Portman Clinics and in 1995 she began therapy and was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>D.I.D is a rare reaction to severe trauma in which the brain splits into multiple personalities as a defence mechanism to cope with chronic trauma.&nbsp; Kim is believed to have suffered severe trauma from sexual abuse as a young child that caused her mind to split into these multiple personalities and develop D.I.D as a “<em>creative way to cope with unbearable pain</em>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2004, after spending a short time with an art therapist, Kim and 12 of her alter personalities developed an interest in painting despite having no formal art training. These 12 artists have their own distinctive artistic styles, colours and themes-</p>



<p>Bonny&#8217;s pictures often feature robotic dancing figures or &#8220;frieze people&#8221;, Suzy repeatedly paints a kneeling mother, Anon paints at night and uses texture in paintings, Abi’s paintings are usually people from a behind view, Patricia paints the desert landscapes which according to her are a “bit boring” and Judy&#8217;s canvasses are large, conceptual pieces which are usually portraits &#8211; some with their eyes open, others shut. Ria on the other hand paints very differently. Using bold bright colours, her childlike but disturbing pieces often reveal deeply traumatic events involving child abuse.</p>



<p>Art has definitely had a therapeutic effect on Kim and instead of coming out as words, the expression comes out in art. These personalities, combined, have had over 60 exhibitions, nationally and internationally.</p>



<p>Generally, Patricia&#8217;s personality switches around four or five times a day &#8211; a switch that can last five minutes, a few hours or several days. Stress or lack of sleep can increase the number of switches, as can painting &#8211; a sign, Patricia believes, that a personality just wants to come out and paint to express themselves.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that she has to live with several alter personalities –– Kim Noble is fortunate enough to be living a relatively normal life. To communicate with &#8220;Patricia,&#8221; &#8220;Judy&#8221;, &#8220;Salome&#8221;, &#8220;Ken&#8221; and the others, Kim&#8217;s therapist sends emails to each of them. All of the personalities have separate email addresses and passwords, and Patricia leaves notes for them. &#8220;Patricia&#8221; says her situation isn&#8217;t such where a single personality represents a specific mood (such as &#8220;anger&#8221; or &#8220;fear&#8221;). Instead, each of her 20 personalities has a full range of emotions and living with Dissociative Identity Disorder means “<em>sharing a household—there are different clothes, closets and toothbrushes for each personality.</em>”</p>



<p>In the past few years, Kim Noble was featured in national newspapers such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthpicturegalleries/5989358/Kim-Noble-the-artist-with-multiple-personalities-each-with-its-own-style-of-painting.html">The Telegraph</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/30/kim-noble-woman-with-100-personalities">The Guardian</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kimnoble.com/independentindex.htm">The Independent</a>&nbsp;and several others. She even appeared at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Introduction-to-Kim-Nobles-Multiple-Personalities-Video">Oprah Show</a>, This Morning Show, Anderson Cooper Show and BBC Radio1 with Victoria Derbyshire.</p>



<h3><strong>DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER</strong></h3>



<p>Dissociative disorders&nbsp;involve problems with memory, emotion, identity, perception, behaviour and sense of self.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="716" height="302" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-14.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2556" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-14.png 716w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-14-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://cdn.website-editor.net/30f11123991548a0af708722d458e476/files/uploaded/DSM%252520V.pdf">Dissociative Identity Disorder</a> is caused by &#8220;<strong>overwhelming experiences, traumatic events, and/or abuse occurring in childhood.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The <strong><a href="https://cdn.website-editor.net/30f11123991548a0af708722d458e476/files/uploaded/DSM%252520V.pdf">DSM-5</a></strong> gives the following diagnostic criteria for Dissociative Identity Disorder:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>“Disruption of identity characterized by <strong>two or more distinct personality states</strong>, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption of marked <strong>discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency</strong>, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behaviour, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Recurrent gaps in the recall</strong> of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.&nbsp;</li><li>The symptoms <strong>cause clinically significant distress</strong> or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&nbsp;</li><li>The <strong>disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice</strong>. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.&nbsp;</li><li>The <strong>symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance</strong> (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behaviour during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).&#8221;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>



<p>Treatment typically involves <strong>psychotherapy</strong> through which people gain control over the symptoms and the dissociative process. Therapy aims at helping individuals <strong>integrate the different elements of identity</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/dissociative-disorders/what-are-dissociative-disorders">Therapy</a> for this trauma based disorder may be difficult and intense as it requires remembering and coping with traumatic experiences of the past. <strong>Cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> and <strong>dialectical behavioural therapy</strong> are two commonly used types of therapy. Like in the case of Kim Noble, art can have a therapeutic effect on individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder. <strong>Hypnosis</strong> has also been found to be helpful in some cases. There are no medications which specifically threat the symptoms of D.I.D, but doctors may prescribe medicines such as anti-psychotic drugs or anti-depressants which may be helpful in the treatment of those specific symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, with appropriate treatment, most of the people suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder are successful in coping with the major symptoms of this rare mental illness and improving their ability to function and live a productive and fulfilling life.&nbsp;</p>
