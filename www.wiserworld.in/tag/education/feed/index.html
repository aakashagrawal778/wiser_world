<h2><strong>The Concept of ‘Being Happy’ in India&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>India, spanning across 29 states and 8 union territories, offers unique ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. While taking a stroll in the streets of India, one can see people doing their daily stuff, whatever that is. Or they are just standing and sitting around talking in a large group of people. Whatever they are engaged in, one thing is universal. They seem to be relaxed in whatever they do and be at peace with themselves and the environment. It is as if they don&#8217;t need the word ‘happy’ in their vocabulary to feel good and relaxed: they are fine with how it is. In India, happiness is not an abstract term. that people all intend to have as their life’s goal.</p>



<p>Maybe the Indian version of happiness has something to do with the present activities. Maybe being happy is just equivalent to being yourself. It&#8217;s more about not wishing for anything else and not to have big desires for which we would be willing to give something dear but to find these desires and happiness in the things we already have and as a result be grateful and at peace. Maybe it is acceptance of what is instead of hoping for what may be.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Happiness, Well-being and Human Development</strong> </h2>



<p>It is quite understandable that the ultimate objective of social and economic development is to provide improvements in the lives of men and women who generate employment now and the younger generation who we hope will generate in the future. This makes the idea of well-being universal: achieving a state of well-being has to be inclusive everywhere, whether in developed or developing countries (OECD, 2015).</p>



<p>Well-being is a focal concept: human well-being provides a means of understanding the growing relationships between apparently diverse ideas and issues that abound as and often appear to compete, in the international agendas. The proper study of human well-being provides a possible way to map out the relationship between poverty and sustainability as it helps us to explore the relationship between various economic dimensions and development such as productivity and efficiency, social cohesion and governance which are vital for the successful overall development (OECD, 2015).</p>



<p>Following the need to study the relevance of happiness, well-being and human development, various methodologies were developed in the international conferences and meetings of the United Nations (UN), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These methodologies presented frameworks that incorporated the socio-economic indicators which can be used to assess the improvements in human well-being. One of the innovations suggested by the well-being approach saw human well-being as a holistic phenomenon. The framework which was put forward by OECD was known as ‘How is Life’ framework. This provides a good example of this multidimensional approach to measuring human well-being that can be used to discuss its relevance for developing countries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="405" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min.png" alt="‘How is Life’ Framework" class="wp-image-4343" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min.png 602w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><figcaption>‘How is Life’ Framework | Source: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/site/oecdgfd/Session%203.1%20-%20GFD%20Background%20Paper.pdf">OECD</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The above figure depicts the process of the OECDs ‘How is Life’ framework which involves three categories of variables. These three categories are listed below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Material Conditions</li><li>Quality of Life</li><li>Sustainability&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Within each of these three categories, there are a certain set of variables upon which data is assembled. Under ‘Material Conditions’ following three variables are listed:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Income and wealth</li><li>Jobs and earnings</li><li>Housing&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The variables included in the category ‘Quality of Life’ are listed below:</p>



<ul><li>Health status</li><li>Work and life balance</li><li>Education and skills</li><li>Social connections</li><li>Civic engagement and governance</li><li>Environmental quality</li><li>Personal security</li><li>Subjective well-being</li></ul>



<p>In the last ‘Sustainability’ category there are four types of capitals which are identified as being significant for the process that produces both material well-being and quality of life outcomes. These are listed below:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Natural capital</li><li>Economic capital</li><li>Human capital</li><li>Social capita</li></ul>



<p>Thus the major innovation will lie in the integrated adoption of a multidimensional approach to understanding progress which integrally considers people’s subjective evaluation of their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Subjective Well-being as an Alternate Tool for Policy Evaluation</strong></h2>



<p>In recent times, subjective wellbeing measures have established themselves as reliable alternatives to standard economic indicators of welfare. Intertest in subjective metrics have been largely driven by the growing dissatisfaction with the conventional use of objective indicators like GDP to evaluate the impact of economic activities on public and private sector decision making. This has led international organisations such as the UN and OECD to advise against using the GDP as a measure of economic progress as it does not capture the outcomes that matter to the well-being of the people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the governments in places like New Zealand, Wales, Iceland and Scotland have advocated and justified the use of subjective well-being matrices in evaluating public policy. As a result of which these countries have recently established the Wellbeing Economy Governments Alliance (WEGO) that aims to promote and share their expertise and transferable policy practices in regard to subjective well-being (Wiking, 2020).</p>



<p>The core benefit of using subjective well-being is that it measures individual experience by directly asking people to report how they feel about their lives. This is in contrast to the conventional economic metrics like inflation rate, unemployment rate and GDP per capita that focus instead on people’s market behaviour. The measures of subjective well-being have proven to be reliable across varying contexts. They remain stable over time, correlate with the third party, associate with physiological makers, respond to life changes and even help in predicting future socio-economic behaviour of individuals including suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is observed that the United Nations for the last eight years has published national rankings of subjective wellbeing in their World Happiness Report. These well-being measures have proven to be aligned with economic objective country conditions, including GDP per capita, life expectancy and levels of corruption. Subjective wellbeing metrics are therefore poised to reveal important underlying dynamics that can help us to understand how people have felt and behaved during the COVID-19 pandemic (Wiking, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Lessons Learnt From Nordic Countries</strong></h2>



<p>From 2013 till today, every time the World Happiness Report (WHR) has published its annual ranking of countries, the five Nordic countries- Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland have all been placed in the top ten with Nordic countries occupying the top three spots in 2017, 2018 and 2019. It is of no doubt that whether we look at the state of democracy, structure of political institutions, lack of corruption, social cohesion, trust between the citizens, gender equality or Human Development Index, one can easily find the Nordic countries in the global top spots (Martela &amp; Greve, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has been a lot of research done on finding the reasons that make Nordic citizens so exceptionally satisfied with their lives. Through reviewing the existing literature the prominent factors responsible for the happiness of Nordic citizens include quality of institutions, low corruption and proper well-functioning of democracy and political institutions. In addition, Nordic citizens experience a high sense of freedom as well as high levels of social trust among each other that play a significant role in determining life satisfaction (Martela &amp; Greve, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denmark is one of the top five happiest nations in the world. It has consistently remained in the top three global spots in the World Happiness Report. Comparing the Indian and Danish GDP, the GDP growth rate of Denmark averaged 0.40% from 1991 to 2018 while the annual growth rate of India’s GDP averaged at 6.61% from 1951 to 2018 (Trading Economics, 2019). Indian economy is much larger as compared to Danish economy. However, there are other factors than financial prosperity and GDP that makes the Danish people among the top happiest in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1-1024x356.png" alt="Denmark vs India" class="wp-image-4342" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1-1024x356.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1-300x104.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1-768x267.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1-1170x406.png 1170w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-min-1.png 1379w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://6e3636b7-ad2f-4292-b910-faa23b9c20aa.filesusr.com/ugd/928487_f35139968bca4668b456726d010e8d45.pdf">World Happiness Report</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If India has to go the Nordic way, it can adopt some features of the happy country as mentioned in Figure 2. It clearly depicts that Denmark does simple things elegantly and makes it the motto of their life. They seek happiness in the small happening of their life and build a hyggelig environment around themselves (Sarkar, 2018).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Weaving the Path for India to Follow the Nordic Happiness Way: A Long Way Ahead</strong></h2>



<p>The happiness of the citizens in India needs to follow a six-pronged strategy to go the Nordic way of living and can be counted as a happy nation in near future. This strategy is depicted in the figure below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min.png" alt="happiness in india" class="wp-image-4344" width="562" height="492" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min.png 602w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /><figcaption>Six Pronged Strategy for India to Go the Nordic Way | <em>Source: Author’s own compilation</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Indian policymakers should carefully observe how education, transport, health and social policies will affect the happiness of citizens. Furthermore, policies that aim to promote public cooperation and equality are equally likely helpful in increasing the subjective indicators of well-being like longevity. India has been a place for poverty research for a very long period of time. With the appropriate policies in place, maybe it could become a laboratory to study happiness one day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Education gives us the manpower to achieve anything and everything around us. It is fundamental for achieving complete human potential and creates a tank full of opportunities for everyone. The New Education Policy will demise the structure of old learning and give rise to an innovative and comprehensive approach. It sets out a vision for 2040.</p>



<h3><strong>Evolution</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The previous policies have focused largely on equality of education and accessibility. The first Education policy came in 1968 and the second in 1986 which was revised in 1992 and the third one is The Education Policy under the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/the-three-consequential-acts-of-the-first-year-of-modi-2-0/">BJP Government</a>. The cabinet approved the New Education Policy on July 29<sup>th</sup>, after a 34-year gap. The other major development since the 1986/92 policy has been the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Act 2009 which laid down legal underpinnings for achieving universal elementary education. The implementation of the policy will further depend on both State and Centre as education is a concurrent subject. The global education development agenda reflected in the Goal 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by India in 2015 &#8211; seeks to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. The major aim of the education policy is to make “India global knowledge of superpower”.<sup>[i]</sup> The world is undergoing rapid changes in various technological, scientific and research advancement. The new policy extensively focuses on these major changes in the system of rote learning.</p>



<h3><strong>A BRIEF</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The New Education Policy has been a mammoth task. Two committees undertook the policy various feedback was taken and widely consulted. The policy document was examined several times before being sent for approval. The new document is radically different from all its predecessors as it outlines a completely new framework for our education. Good education policy is where wide learning is offered with good infrastructure and appropriate resources are provided. The key points which the policy emphasis on are:</p>



<ul><li>Recognising and fostering every individual’s capabilities and sensitizing teachers and parents as well to promote students in holistic development.</li><li>One of the essential fundamentals which have been left unaddressed until now is Early Childhood Care and Education. The policy says, over 85% of a child’s brain development occurs prior to the age 8. Thus, it focuses on achieving Foundational Literacy and Numeracy for all students by grade 3<sup>rd</sup>.</li><li>Flexibility for learners to choose their learning projectors and choose their life paths according to their talent. Furthermore, there will be no hard separation between the streams. This also promotes the dispel of various notions of society and hierarchies.</li><li>Multidisciplinary approach in order to promote uniformity and integrity for all knowledge. Emphasis on conceptual understanding and critical thinking.</li><li>The vocational programs from school education. The policy has reconceptualised practical learning and give it a heads up. Which focuses on giving students an opportunity to intern at school level and learn a programming language.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The fundamental keynotes ensure integrity, transparency and empowerment of all students.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Vision of the Policy</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>School Learning</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The policy envisages that the 10+2 old schooling structure will be modified with a 5+3+3+4 which will cover the age group of 3-6 and brings early childhood education. It constitutes the foundational stage of education. The restructure has been proposed keeping in mind the holistic development of the children. As the policy focuses on &#8216;the overarching goal would be to ensure universal access to high-quality ECCE across the country. It facilities amalgamation project led ecosystem of education which focuses on process and not just an outcome. It shifts the focus from conventional learning practices of delivering assignments. The Boards are redesigned now students can appear for it twice one for main examination and other for improvement if they desired. NEP 2020 also proposes a shift from summative assessments to regular and formative assessments. Which will focus on analysis, critical thinking and conceptual clarity? The government also focuses on multilingualism and suggests that students until class 5 should be taught in their mother tongue or regional language. This received a mixed reaction some says it will promote multilingualism while others comment it as a downfall for rural-urban students who wish to learn English.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The introduction to vocational studies grades 6 onwards and creation of National Committee for the Integration of Vocational Education (NCIVE) is an extremely important decision to remove the societal stigma attached with taking vocation as a career. Lastly one of the major problematic situations for every student has been choosing the streams, one of the critical factors of the new policy is flexibility. The dismantling of the rigid distinction of academics gives students much more flexibility and freedom to choose subjects of their interest and desires. Thus, it focuses on universalising education from early childhood.</p>



<h4><strong>Higher Education</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/nep-2020-new-education-policy-to-revamp-the-education-system-of-21st-century-1711501-2020-08-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makers </a>of this policy, some of the salient problems in the higher education institutions in our country is lack of research, limited teachers, less multidisciplinary courses and poor institutional governance.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Recognising the problems the policymakers came up with various new key ingredients. The decision to break the wall of streams and bring in flexibility, provisions of freedom to exit and entre courses, credit-based system and introduction to a 4-year degree with research.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The document also states universities among the world top 100 will be able to set up in India. However, this will only process ones the HRD Ministry brings a new law that includes the details of how foreign universities will operate. We can also see a partnership between government and private educational programmes which will result in the fruitful outcome and a shift into the latest technologies. Among the several new features of NEP 2020, one of the best is granting more autonomy to educational institutions which are providing quality education. The other is a single regulator for higher education. The other significant reform is the provision of multiple entries and exits points. This will help students to pursue the course of their choice at their own pace and without getting affected by the impact of their personal circumstances. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It also eliminates the MPhil programme which does not affect higher education trajectory at all. But it also emphasis equally on research and offers a 4-year undergraduate degree. As research is the foundation of knowledge creation and it plays a crucial role in the upliftment of any human. The policy envisages the creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF). Its main objective will be to provide areas of themes for research and coordination and build a platform for budding researchers which the nation strives for the next coming decade. However, the biggest challenge for the government would be to reduce the digital disparity which exists among students as well as teachers. Additionally, we also need to focus upon the skill development and training of educators and teachers who will help the nation in the rebuilding project.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These are some of the pathbreaking provisions which NEP 2020 focuses on. It opens the door for hopes and aspirations. It is visionary and transformational however, the success lies in its implementation.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">South Africa, the southernmost nation on the African mainland, known for its varied topography, natural beauty, cultural diversity, all of which have made the nation a destination for travellers to spend vacations, since the lawful closure of politically sanctioned racial segregation. South Africa is situated great may miles far off from the major African urban communities, like, Lagos and Cairo and approximately 6000 miles away from Europe, North America, and Eastern Asia, where its major trading accomplice’s can be found, also which helped reinforce the system of apartheid in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">With that framework, the minority population established segregation among housing, education, and all spheres of life, creating three nations: one of the whites [comprising of people groups essentially of British and Dutch [Boer] family line, who battled for ages to increase political supremacy, a battle that arrived at its violent peak with the South African War of 1899–1902); one of the blacks (comprising of such people groups as the San hunter and gatherers of the north-western desert, the Zulu herders of the eastern levels, and the Khoekhoe ranchers of the southern Cape districts); and one of &#8220;Coloureds&#8221; (blended race individuals) and ethnic Asians (Indians, Malays, Filipinos, and Chinese). </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The politically-sanctioned racial segregation system was despised and even fervently opposed by much of the world, and by the mid-1980s South Africa ended up among the world&#8217;s pariah states, the subject of financial and social blacklists that influenced pretty much every part of life. In the need compelled to stand up to the unsound idea of ethnic separatism in a multicultural land, the South African government of F.W.de Klerk (1989-94) started to rescind politically-sanctioned racial segregation laws. That procedure thusly set moving a change towards universal suffrage and true electoral democracy, which finished in the 1994 election which the appointed the long-imprisoned leader Nelson Mandela. This change witnessed the nation gaining social equality in a brief timeframe. South Africa has three cities that serve as its capital: Pretoria (executive), Cape Town (legislative), and Bloemfontein (judicial). </p>



<h3><strong>ECONOMY</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The<a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/investment-opportunites-in-africa-an-overview/"> economy of South Africa</a> took a drastic turn in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century when jewels and gold were found there, followed by large investments from foreign capitals. In the years after World War II, the nation formed a much-developed manufacturing base and encountered exceptional development rates, and at that time its development rated were most noteworthy in the world. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">However, South Africa has encountered economic problems since the late 1970s because of the apartheid policies which led may countries to holdback investments and to impose international restrictions against it. South Africa&#8217;s economy didn&#8217;t quickly bounce back in the mid-1990s while apartheid was being disassembled, as capitalists held on to perceive what might occur. After the 1994 democratic elections, the investments poured in. Post-apartheid South Africa was then confronted with the issue of incorporating the recently disappointed and mistreated greater part into the economy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"> In 1996 the legislature made a five-year plan—Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR)— that concentrated on privatization and the evacuation of trade controls. GEAR was successful in accomplishing a portion of its objectives yet was hailed by some as establishing a significant framework for future financial advancement. The government additionally executed new laws and projects intended to improve the monetary circumstance of the underestimated larger part. The Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) was introduced, it aimed to increase employment opportunities for those who were characterized under apartheid as black, coloured, and Indians, enhancing their working skills and incomes. This strategy was further extended through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act of 2003, which attended to gender, social and racial inequality.</p>



<h3><strong>RESOURCES AND POWER&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">South Africa is plentiful in an assortment of minerals. Other than diamonds and gold it also has a reserve for iron ore, platinum, manganese, chromium, copper, uranium, silver, beryllium, and titanium. Despite the fact that manufacturing has provided employment for decades, contributing towards the Gross Development Product (GDP) than mining, the mining segment keeps on shaping the centre of the South African economy as it holds companies to invest in other economic activities. Gold remains the most significant mineral—South Africa is the world&#8217;s largest producers—and stores are enormous; in any case, creation is gradually declining, and costs have never risen to their stupendous highs of the mid-1970s.</p>



<h3><strong>EDUCATION&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since 1994, South Africa has made incredible walks in understanding <a href="https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/education">the right to education</a>, quickly fabricating an effective, available and quality education system for youngsters and youths. This outstanding advancement has been recorded over the three parts of fundamental training in youth improvement, primary and secondary education. However, notwithstanding these accomplishments, the possibilities and openings stood to kids in South Africa are still generally dependent upon which side of the inequality they were born. Poverty and Inequality stay cruel determinants, forestalling such huge numbers of kids from getting to the fundamental education that they deserve. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">From birth to the last year of high school, kids born in poor family face a lot of challenges, which their co-students coming from a wealthy background may not. While access to ECD centres has expanded, the nature of learning and development programmes remain at test. An underqualified workforce paired with the poor implementation of the learning programmes sways ECD results. While giving quality learning and basic education has its difficulties, keeping youngsters in school to finish their education is another. A little more than a fourth of South Africa&#8217;s total children drop out of school before the finish of Matric – most of whom are from helpless territories and defenceless against various boundaries to education. This disparity of access is compounded by a sexual orientation imbalance that impacts little youngsters particularly.</p>



<h3><strong>SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <a href="https://www.gov.za/about-sa/international-relations">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> is answerable for South African foreign policy strategies. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) inside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conducts contact with foreign governments and international associations on all issues influencing official relations. These relations are led through foreign government authorities, through representatives licensed to South Africa, and through South Africa&#8217;s authorized embassies, departments, and different missions abroad. Until the mid-1990s, the DFA and the conciliatory corps went up against various counter-establishment &#8220;strategic administrations&#8221; run by antiapartheid associations in a state of banishment, particularly the ANC. The point of these equal correspondence channels was to disconnect the South African government inside the global network as a method for forcing Pretoria to abrogate apartheid.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">After the abrogation of apartheid and the initiation of the democratically chosen Government of National Unity, South Africa&#8217;s foreign relations significantly transformed. The nation&#8217;s discretionary segregation finished, and existing relations with different nations and with international associations improved. South Africa restored discretionary and trade relations with numerous nations, especially in Africa, and set up new relations with some previous approvals &#8220;hardliners”, for example, India, Pakistan, Bahrain, Malaysia, Jordan, Libya, and Cuba. A few provincial and international associations welcomed South Africa to join or to renew its membership, including the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the United Nations (UN).</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"> In addition, South Africa participated in international and bilateral sport, academic, and scientific activities, often for the first time in decades. Relations with the nations of the previous Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe improved. South Africa had full political binds with thirty-nine nations in 1990; that number expanded to sixty-nine out of 1993, and to a maximum of 147 in 1995. Various foreign policies were brought into action before Nelson Mandela was appointed as President in 1994, for example, in mid-1994 de Klerk and Mandela, alongside the leaders of Botswana and Zimbabwe, interceded a conclusion to a military revolt in neighbouring Lesotho. In mid-1994, South Africa gave its first help to a UN peacekeeping activity when it provided medical clinic hardware for Rwanda. Likewise, in 1994, President Mandela consented to help settle the unmanageable common war in Angola, although he advised against unrealistically high expectations in this and other profound established political and ethnic clashes.</p>



<h3><strong>INDIA- SOUTH AFRICA RELATIONS</strong></h3>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://www.gov.za/about-sa/international-relations">India&#8217;s relationship with South Africa</a> is both fundamental and remarkable, going back a few centuries and is tied down in common ideals, ideas, interests, and icons – like Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. In any case, their respective relationship stayed stressed for quite a while because of South Africa&#8217;s apartheid government. After its independence, India began its struggle for the position at international associations like United Nations (UN), Commonwealth, and Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and was the main nation to have trade relations 1946, and in this way forced political and financial assets. Following a hole of four decades, India restored exchange and business ties in 1993, after South Africa finished its standardized racial isolation. In May 1993, a Cultural Centre was opened in Johannesburg. In November 1993, strategic and consular relations were re-established during the visit of then South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha to India. The Indian High Commission in Pretoria was opened in May 1994. In 1996, India opened its permanent Office of High Commission in Cape Town, which was re-assigned as Consulate General of India in 2011.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India and South Africa&#8217;s shared basic encounters and aggregate quality have formed how the two of them see the world together. As two countries who have shared their battle to independence, the obligation to improve the lives of others is inserted inside India and South Africa&#8217;s consciousness. After South Africa established democracy in 1994, it was the Red Fort Declaration on Strategic Partnership among India and South Africa, marked in March 1997 by then PM Shri Deve Gowda and Nelson Mandela, which set the boundaries for a revived relationship. The twentieth commemoration of marking of the revelation was honoured by an India-South African social spectacle involving music and dance performances, and an occasion composed by High Commission of India, Pretoria on April 9, 2017. This Strategic Partnership between the two nations was again re-certified in the Tshwane Declaration (October 2006). Both these announcements have been instrumental components that have contributed in the past to both South Africa and India for accomplishing their national objectives.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">List of <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/india-south-africa-relations-a-perennial-bond-47557/">MoUs signed</a> during the 10<sup>th</sup> BRICS Summit, signed between India and South Africa were;</p>



<ul><li>Memorandum of Understanding between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India and the Agricultural Research Council, Pretoria, South Africa on Agricultural Research and Education.</li><li>Memorandum of Understanding between Government of the Republic of South Africa and Government of India regarding the setting up of the &#8220;Gandhi Mandela Centre of Specialisation in Artisan Skills&#8221; in South Africa.</li><li>Memorandum of Understanding between Indian Space Research Organisation and the South African National Space Agency on Cooperation in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">South Africa can use its diplomacy not only at governmental but also as a non-governmental level. Utilizing scholastics and specialists outside of government to &#8220;include&#8221; information and ability to South African discretion, have gotten progressively normal. It is to be trusted that this training will proceed to help give what is expected to compelling interest in an inexorably intricate world. Thorough training of professional diplomats is, however, not unimportant either, and such persons should be retained for the foreign service to establish an ever-growing pool of experience in the DFA. These are on the whole parts of the &#8220;small scale level&#8221; of strategy and fundamental if the nation is to prevail at the global level.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Moreover, thought should be given to the decision of various types of diplomacy and their blend; an inappropriate decision can have genuine results, as the Nigerian debacle would delineate. The topic of what balance ought to be kept up among respective and multilateral discretion has been raised; summitry should be utilized wisely; a fitting job for innovation in diplomacy should be discovered; the degree to which the nine areas or locales in South Africa can be permitted to lead their foreign relations should be considered; and, troublesome decisions should be made in regards to accentuation on various regions. Prioritising in diplomacy appears to be unavoidable as the conceivable outcomes are practically unfathomable, though the assets are quite restricted. This isn&#8217;t a difficult extraordinary to South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The South African government is no world-exhausted system which has seen everything previously, but a youthful, excited organization anxious to show its gifts and beliefs. The government believes in the excellencies of relationship, co-activity and human qualities. It has understood that the present chiefs should be acceptable ambassadors who can adjust domestic and international pressure, who can make arrangements, and resolve debates, characterizing the interests of their states in harmonious manners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">It is estimated that sixty-six percent of India’s population lives in its villages. Despite, the internet becoming synonymous with urbanisation, it is the <strong>rural India that holds the key to the digitalisation of the nation</strong>. With the internet making inroads into our villages, it becomes imperative to explore the impacts of this on the rural society. The article aims to study the impacts of internet penetration over the lives of children in rural areas. It will analyse the immediate and long term implications of digitalisation on the educational, social and physical growth of these children. The article also aims to highlight the existing challenges and the role of actors, both state and non-state, in overcoming them.</p>



<h3><strong>Digitalising Indian Villages</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.32.38-PM-min-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2574" width="363" height="469" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.32.38-PM-min-1.jpeg 702w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.32.38-PM-min-1-232x300.jpeg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/rural-india-to-drive-internet-users-in-india-report/75560221">Economic Times</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to a report by <a href="https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/rural-india-to-drive-internet-users-in-india-report/75560221">Kantar</a>, rural India, with 304 million monthly active internet users, will be the major driver of internet usage in the country. Rural India saw 4 times more growth in active users than urban India. With increasing access to the internet, rural India has found more opportunities to grow. Farmers can now get connected to the National Mandi for their produce, the artisans can reach out to global consumers through e-commerce and the younger generation can learn better skills and get better employment opportunities. It has also strengthened Panchayati Raj governance and helped in better implementation of government schemes. Its potential impacts on the children can lay the ground for a healthier and more skilled generation.</p>



<h3><strong>Internet in the Education Sector</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Even with the state making sure that education as a right is accessible by all, a large number of rural children are either not able to make it to schools or have to face a lack of quality education. Some of the schools are located in remote areas which makes reaching the school a challenge itself. Schools in rural areas also suffer from lack of infrastructure and shortage of teachers. According to a report by <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/blog/education/digital-education-among-students-in-rural-areas/"><strong>Forbes India</strong></a>, there are 97,273 single teacher schools in India, this is equivalent to 8.8% of the total schools in India. These hurdles are a major reason for school dropout rates as well. This makes it difficult to achieve the United Nation’s fourth Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to provide inclusive and equitable quality education to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2017/internet-access-and-education/"><strong>Access to the internet</strong></a> is fundamental to achieving this vision for the future.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Internet-based education has the potential to mitigate issues of quality and disinterest. Teaching through the use of video lessons can make the lessons interactive. Internet also opens up an opportunity to connect with the wider world outside the classroom. In addition to its use by teachers, guidance on how to utilise the power of the internet can encourage students to explore and learn from this repository of knowledge. Their skill and knowledge accusation would not be restricted by the syllabus. Internet also makes it possible for the teacher to reach out to a large number of students across various locations at the same time. This can play a major role in solving the issue of teacher shortage in the country.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://www.villagesquare.in/2017/10/27/technology-helps-assams-rural-children-learn-better/"><strong>The Integrative approach to technology project</strong></a> being implemented in the seven north and northeastern states of India is an indicator of how the internet can be utilised to deliver knowledge in rural areas. According to the teachers in the states, project-based learning through the internet has made the students more inquisitive. The lessons have become more interactive and students were able to connect even the abstract mathematical theorems to real-life situations. The internet also allowed students to access information in their local languages. Internet thus has the potential to strengthen the efforts of making the basic human right to education become universally accessible.</p>



<h3><strong>Internet and Social Growth</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Childhood has, on numerous occasions, been considered the base of a healthy youth and an overall productive life. But there are a number of challenges in ensuring that every child has a healthy and enriching childhood. Instances of child labour are high in the country. Child marriages&nbsp;and malnourishment are other inhibitors to a normal childhood. Inadequate nutrition in the first 1000 days of a child’s life can lead to stunted growth, associated with impaired cognitive ability and reduced school and work performance. As per the Global Nutrition Report, 46.6 million children in India are stunted.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.43.12-PM-min-1024x697.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2579" width="553" height="376" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.43.12-PM-min-1024x697.jpeg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.43.12-PM-min-300x204.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.43.12-PM-min-768x523.jpeg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-04-at-9.43.12-PM-min.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /><figcaption><em><a href="http://www.soundnlight.in/2018/10/17/">Digital Sakhi Programme</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Internet has the potential to change this. It allows the information to reach the most remote of areas. Organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, are utilising its powers to reach out to the target audiences. Its role in the spread of education has been discussed above. All this together results in better awareness about the rights of children and the legal action that follows the breach of rules. It’s a two-way road, community activists can also use internet to reach out to organisations for help in order to stop child marriages or child labour. An interesting example of the use of internet to reduce or stop child marriages is to be found in Bangladesh. They, together with Plan International, have launched an app that allows the marriage registrars, solemnisers or matchmakers to establish the true age of the Bride and Groom. Since the physical documents were easy to forge, this app helps to digitally verify the document. It has helped to stop as many as 3700 child marriages. Government of India also launched a website pencil.gov.in to empower and encourage the civil society’s participation in the Anti- child labour programmes. It allows them to raise a complaint online instantly. Thus, through these applications and websites, internet allows for a an active community participation in the achievement of global goals with respect to Children marriages and child labour.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Another important hurdle to an active and fruitful childhood is lack of adequate nutrition. When the women in the family do not receive the nutrition they must, it leads to rising cases of children being malnourished or being born with physical and mental deficiencies. A malnourished child cannot even make use of his/her cognitive skills and usually lags behind in life. <strong>Targeting the mother and child health, thus, could go a long way in reducing malnutrition among rural kids. </strong>Ministry of Women and Child Development, recently launched ICDS-CAS ( Common Application Software). It utilises internet technology for real-time Monitoring of nutritional outcomes. It would help in better tracking of beneficiaries and would make sure that home visits for pregnant women are done on time. It digitalises data entry and thus makes nutrition statuses available at all times. It has also improved the supervision of ground-level Anganwadi Workers and Lady Supervisors. This ensure that all benefits reach the mother on time, she takes proper nutritional supplements and gets an institutional delivery done.&nbsp; Internet, thus, has the potential to bring about improvement in mother-child health. This will have a domino effect on the lifelong productivity of the child.</p>



<h3><strong>There is still more left to do!</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Government of India has, over the years, taken a number of steps to reduce the rural-urban digital divide. Going back five years, the government launched the Digital India mission. It was an umbrella programme with schemes in areas of digital infrastructure, digital empowerment, on-demand government services. One of the main agendas of the programme is to expand internet connectivity to rural areas. The government aims to achieve the goal of a digital village &#8211; rural areas with telemedicine facilities, virtual classes and solar power based WiFi hot spots. National Optic Fibre Network will be used to ensure internet connectivity to 2,50,000 gram panchayats. Rural Internet Mission involves the conversion of some 1,50,000 Post Offices into internet-based multi-service centres. In December last year, government launched a project with an investment of seven trillion &#8211; <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/rs-7-trn-plan-to-provide-internet-access-to-rural-areas-by-2022-launched-119121701729_1.html">The National Broadband Mission</a>. The agenda is to provide broadband access to all villages by 2022. Three million route kilometres of optical fibre cable is planned to be laid and density of tower per thousand is expected to increase.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Despite the fact that rural internet users are on a rise due to the efforts of the government but there are still hurdles left to cross. Lack of infrastructure necessary for the setting up of the connections is a major issue. In remote areas and difficult terrains, it becomes extremely difficult to lay down the fibre optic cables. The rural areas also suffer from poor internet speed making the use of internet ineffective. With widespread poverty, not everyone is able to afford a smartphone or personal computer to access the internet. Fluctuating electricity availability is another issue.&nbsp; We have come a long way but there is still a long road to tread.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Internet has immense potential to bring about a positive change in the lives of the rural kids. This can be a major push to India’s dream of reaping the demographic dividend. Policymakers have realised the importance of India’s villages in making India a digital nation. But while making all the efforts we need to stay aware of the fact that rural India also suffers from digital illiteracy. Hence,&nbsp; according to a study by the World Bank, just providing them with internet connection will not lead to full utilisation of the internet potential. Even in school, teachers need to be well trained in how to prepare and disseminate an internet-based lesson. The ground level workers in villages need digital guidance so that they can efficiently use internet for awareness and monitoring. The policymakers and development experts seeking to improve the lives of rural kids must make sure that increasing internet penetration must be balanced with digitally skilled citizens.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">E-learning emerged as the go-to solution for schools and colleges who were looking to resume classes despite the country-wide lockdown. But it has its fair share of challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Covid-19 pandemic has put a standstill to regular schools and colleges. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi on 24th March announced a nationwide lockdown to fight against coronavirus or COVID-19. Hence, schools and colleges all over India had to shut. Some state governments had already ordered schools and colleges to send the students back to their homes and close down the campus.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since the new academic session was to start in schools, they did not have a choice but to start online classes for students. Colleges too went ahead with the online teaching as they too had to complete the semester. Online classes may sound fun but it comes with its challenges. Some of these challenges and issues are raised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Concerns raised by UNICEF and UNESCO</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">E-learning has arguably helped educational institutes around India beat the Covid-19 lockdown to “<a target="_blank" href="https://theprint.in/india/education/schools-to-continue-online-classes-until-3-may-no-plan-to-advance-summer-break-hrd-ministry/402334/?amp" rel="noreferrer noopener">push ahead with the academic calendar</a>.” But experts including those at UNESCO and UNICEF have raised concerns w.r.t. these online classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While a few experts are worried about the potential dangers of longer internet exposure for younger students, some of them are scared that this digital shift may alienate economically backward students&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://theprint.in/india/education/no-gadgets-no-studies-what-online-classes-mean-for-16-lakh-poor-students-in-delhi-schools/406837/?amp" rel="noreferrer noopener">who do not possess the technology</a>&nbsp;required for online lessons.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">On 15 April, UNICEF said that &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/children-increased-risk-harm-online-during-global-covid-19-pandemic" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of children are at increased risk</a>&nbsp;of harm as their lives move increasingly online during the lockdown in the Covid-19 pandemic”.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As per UNICEF’s statement, “the internet exposure puts children at the risk of online&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://theprint.in/india/governance/parents-of-sexually-abused-children-reject-death-penalty/52042/?amp" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual exploitation</a>&nbsp;and grooming, as predators look to exploit the Covid-19 pandemic”.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A greater internet exposure leads to online grooming which is a serious concern in this social media age. It involves mischievous and predatory adults who build fake online relationships with gullible children and trick or pressure them into different kinds of sexual behaviour.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore says that “under the shadow of Covid-19, the lives of millions of children have temporarily shrunk to just their homes and their screens. We must help them navigate this new reality.”</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">UNESCO published a report on 21st April, which highlighted another major concern regarding the online classes. The report said, “Half of the total number of learners — some 826 million (82.6 crores) students — kept out of the classroom by the Covid-19 pandemic, do not have access to a household computer and 43 per cent (706 million or 70.6 crores) have no internet at home at all, at a time when digital distance learning mediums are used to ensure educational continuity in the vast majority of countries.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>A Stark Reality</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Now even though the above-mentioned concerns are very serious, educational institutions have no choice but to conduct classes online. But as already stated above not everyone can afford online education. There are various reasons for this, the prominent one being, lack of internet in households. According to a National Sample Survey report, “less than 15 percent of rural Indian households (and 42 percent urban ones) have access to the Internet.” This gives us an idea that the majority of students are not able to get the education they rightfully deserve. The fact that not many poor households can even afford a smartphone is also a major concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The other issue is the technological issue. According to a report published in The Indian Express, the University of Hyderabad did an in-house survey of around 2,500 students on issues pertaining to online teaching. The results showed that 90 percent of the respondents have a mobile phone but only about 63 percent of them could access online classes infrequently or they could not attend at all. 40 percent of the surveyed students reported unreliable connectivity as being a major deterrent while 30 percent of them cited the cost of data as an issue. 10 percent, again a significant number of students, reported uncertain electricity supply as a concern.</p>



<h3><strong>Other Problems with Online Classes</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As is quite evident from the figures above that many students in India cannot access online education because of a lack of internet. There is an illusion among those in urban areas that the internet has reached every nook and corner of our country but a report by NITI Aayog, called “<a href="https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2019-01/Strategy_for_New_India_0.pdf">Strategy For New India@75</a>” highlighted that at least 55,000 villages in India don’t even have mobile network coverage.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">One area which has been ignored to an extent is stereotypes associated with using mobile phones in rural areas. According to a report in Newsclick, Gaurav Sikka, assistant professor of geography at Lalit Narayan Mithila University in Darbhanga, Bihar, said that “the online mode of teaching is widening the social and gender divide.” He further said, “I teach a majority of students who hail from conservative families where the parents have no idea that the students can take classes online. Thus, they are denying the girl students access to mobile phones.”</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">This gap between the haves and have nots has become a major hindrance in providing education to most of the students. Governments in the past came up with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_Children_to_Free_and_Compulsory_Education_Act,_2009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009</a> or RTE under which education was free for all the students under the age of 6 to 14. Some state governments did extremely well under the RTE but many of them did not focus much.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg" alt="E-Learning" class="wp-image-1951" width="468" height="312" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nikhita-s-NsPDiPFTp4c-unsplash-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><figcaption>Girl from Karnataka government school writing in Telugu on the board</figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Now under RTE, it&#8217;s the duty and responsibility of the states to provide the basic infrastructure to students so that no student suffers because of lack of facility. But still, government schools all over India are struggling to conduct classes, and the schools which have been able to conduct classes see a very low turnout.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The elite schools in urban areas initially had trouble making the switch to online teaching but since then, they have been able to take regular online lessons. Although students are not facing connectivity issues as such, they certainly feel online teaching is no match for physical classes. The students feel that it’s difficult to interact with teachers and the teachers feel the same way too. Teachers say that they developed a methodology over the years to teach students in a physical classroom but they now have to adjust to online teaching. They say that they cannot figure out during a class if the students are attentive or not and also subjects like mathematics cannot be taught online because it requires a lot of practice and hence it is difficult to monitor each student during the online lesson.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion and Suggestions</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It’s pretty unclear what lies ahead and no one can predict anything at this stage, so the need of the hour is that the state governments take all the necessary steps to provide the basic facilities to students so that they can continue with their education. Internet penetration can’t happen overnight and students too can’t become tech-savvy in a day so it is suggested that classes be recorded and broadcasted through television channels to students in rural areas. Doordarshan the state broadcaster could be used for this purpose. At the same time, the state government must ensure that there are enough television sets in the area for the students.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Along with this, the school administration must prepare themselves and better internet facilities so that in due course a better education could be delivered to students. These steps along with the students&#8217; zeal to learn will definitely make India stand out from the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In September 2015, at the United Nations General Assembly Meeting, governments around the world committed themselves to the 17 <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/coronavirus-environment-coronavirus-pandemics-impact-on-the-environment/">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> to balance the social, economic and ecological dimensions of sustainable development. The SDGs are an extension of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which expired at the end of 2015. UN member states are expected to form frameworks and take responsibility for the fulfilment of these SDGs by 2030 in their respective nations. But is our government going in the right direction toward education?</p>



<p>Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all like the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (<a href="https://in.one.un.org/page/sustainable-development-goals/sdg-4/">SDG 4</a>) perfectly encapsulates the motto- “<strong>Leave no one behind</strong>”. However, India’s progress in attaining this goal is a mixed success story. With innumerable schemes like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Mid-day Meal, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Beti Bachao, Beti Padao and the Right to Education (RTE) Act, we all expected modification in the sector with everyone getting free access to quality education and thus able to improve their living standards. But that is not the story here. Although India has made progress in getting children enrolled in educational institutions, it is still not enough. In fact, according to the <a href="http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/SDGProgressReport2020.pdf">Progress Report 2020</a>, the Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) for primary education has decreased from 87.1% in 2015-16 to 82.5% in 2017-18. Similarly, for the upper primary, it has decreased from 74% to 72.6%. But still, India has come a long way since 1947 in terms of quantity of education and it’s doing better in that regard. What it really lacks in is the <strong>quality of education</strong>.</p>



<p>Despite implementing the Right to Education Act 2009, India&#8217;s performance is worse than the developing South-East Asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam with the mean years of schooling at 6.5 years according to the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking">Human Development Report 2019</a>. The learning outcomes are even worse. According to <a href="http://img.asercentre.org/docs/ASER%25202018/Release%2520Material/aserreport2018.pdf">ASER Report 2018</a>, only 44.2% of Standard V students and 69% of Standard VIII students in rural government schools can read a Standard II level text and this proportion has only decreased in the last 10 years. Between 2008 and 2018, the proportion of ‘division solvers’ in Standard V in rural government schools went down from 34% to 22.7% and that for the students in Standard VIII went down from 65.2% to 40%. These figures are just outrageous. There is a huge variation in the literacy and numeracy levels among these students which is the most critical constraint in the structure of the Indian Education system. The learning outcomes for rural private schools are no better than rural public schools. PISA is an international assessment that provides cross-national learning benchmarks and helps nations improving their learning levels. The last time India participated in PISA in 2009-10, <strong>it stood at the second last place</strong>. Imagine the learning deficits that have accumulated from years of low-quality education. When the time comes to look for employment, what are these young people trained in this mangy manner going to find?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-1.png" alt="education" class="wp-image-1861" width="612" height="403"/></figure></div>



<p>With the reduction in profitability from agricultural activities, parents in rural areas have let their children study well beyond the age when they have themselves joined the workforce in hope that it will be a way out of their insecure farm life. However, when these children graduate, they will find that there are hardly any good jobs. It’s a disaster that is waiting to happen. Even if we look at the whole population instead of just these poorly educated rural children, the story remains the same. The <a href="https://www.aspiringminds.com/research-reports/national-employability-report-for-engineers-2019/">Annual Employability Survey 2019</a> report by Aspiring Minds revealed that only 20% of the Indian engineers were found employable in the knowledge economy and a meagre 2.5% of them possess new-age skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that the industry actually requires. These figures can be justified if we look at the proportion of those above 5 years of age who are able to use the internet which is just 20.1%. Estimates suggest that only 2.3% of India’s workforce has undergone formal skill training compared to Germany’s 75% and South Korea’s 96%. The enrolment rate for tertiary education is merely 28.3% which points towards failed policies. This all has led to a large fraction of the workforce having insufficient work skills. If the employability remains so low, we cannot ensure a sustainable pool of students enrolled in schools as their trust in the system erodes.</p>



<p>According to a report tabled in the parliament by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), we have over <strong>100,000 schools with solitary teachers</strong>. At the national level, over 75 per cent of schools have a multi-grade situation with one teacher being coerced into teaching students of several grades in the same classroom. The high rate of teacher absenteeism, limited time spent on teaching when the teacher is in the class and generally poor quality of education are among important reasons for an abysmally low number of enrolments as reported by the NITI Aayog. In February 2015, Maharashtra held an <a href="http://www.mscepune.in/TET%25202014/TET_Result_2014_Prasidhipatrak_190315.pdf">evaluation test</a> for teachers of government-run schools. Only a little over 1% primary teachers and 4.9% upper primary teachers who took the test passed. This is a furious figure and perfectly explains where the problem lies in our education system.</p>



<p>Talking about inclusion for everybody, India’s position is abominable in that too. Literacy rate of male population above 15 years of age is <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/country/in">82%</a> while that of the female population is just 65% which is a stark difference. The reasons for females for not attending school being the classic ones &#8211; engaged in domestic activities, financial constraints, marriage or not interested in getting education. The enrolment rate of children with disabilities is mortifying with merely 1.18% in primary education, 0.56% in secondary education and 0.25% in higher secondary education. There is an urgent need to develop infrastructure to accommodate these children as hardly 22% of the schools have disabled-friendly toilets and only 33% have disabled-friendly ramps. Not only this but only 55 in 100 schools have basic handwashing facilities.</p>



<p>The Draft National Education Policy 2019 (DNEP) bought really good suggestions regarding the separation of regulators from operators and policymakers thus avoiding the conflict of interest, significant autonomy to the university system and Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) but it fails to address the real crisis which is teacher quality or rather teacher’s unaccountability. The underlying notion for all the reforms suggested is that there is a lack of resources which can be in connection with infrastructure, quantity of teachers or even quantity of trained teachers and this is a fundamentally mistaken idea. The real culprit is not the lack of inputs but the absence of accountability of schools, teachers and the system as a whole.</p>



<p>The new education policy also asked to double the public expenditure on education from 10.6% (2018-19) to 20%. It is not a sensible thing to do in the current circumstances of wastage of government resources. Public Schools with <strong>fewer than 50 students and an average of 29 students per school stood at </strong><a href="https://niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/coop/20.pdf"><strong>3.7 lakh</strong></a><strong> schools</strong> in 2014-15. They represented 36% of all public schools. This is a catastrophic situation. This is too small a size for it to be pedagogically or even economically viable as the per-pupil salary expenditure becomes really high. At the point where the learning outcomes of these government schools are pitiably low, almost <a href="https://accountabilityindia.in/publication/state-education-finances-a-deep-dive-into-school-education-finances-in-eight-states/">80%</a> of the public expenditure on education in 2018-19 is spent on teacher’s salaries. In a state like Uttar Pradesh, there is an increase of <a href="https://ccs.in/sites/default/files/research/research-per-pupil-expenditure-up-govt-schools-march-2018.pdf">15%</a> in salaries each year where inflation is just 3-3.5%. All the capacity of the state to increase expenditure on education is being tapped by salaries alone. There is such an inefficient use of the government resources that any effort towards increasing education spending is like putting your money in a blackhole. What we need to do is put in place some new governance mechanisms to increase efficiency instead of increasing the budget itself.</p>



<p>The policy talks about the issue of small schools being economically suboptimal and suggests for consolidation of these schools by creating large school complexes. But this again won’t be beneficial for students if it is not done keeping in mind that these small schools cater to the needs of those living in isolated and remote areas. An independent study by&nbsp;<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/school-mergers-brought-down-enrolments-study/articleshow/71572089.cms">Accountability Initiate (AI)</a>&nbsp;maintained that Rajasthan saw a 6% decline in enrolment of backward social groups including Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Castes (OBCs) when small schools were merged. The study highlighted that the stakeholders in the process namely teachers, principals and parents were never consulted. If providing the required number of teachers for every school has become physically and economically unviable, we must seriously review the earlier approach of providing a school in every habitation within one or three kilometres or providing a school where 20 or more school-going children live. If they want to consolidate schools, they should provide the children with facilities to go to school.</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p>India has a long way to go to provide quality education to all. It especially needs to focus on rural and backward regions’ education which is in poor health and needs an overhaul. India’s history is strewed with ambitious education policies that have not been fully implemented. The latest National Education Policy has a possibility of being similar to the previous policies in terms of poor implementation unless the government addresses the reasons behind the past policy implementation failures and makes conscious efforts to amend the mistakes. These points are important because in India what we tend to do is write policies and plans that say the right things but are unable to drive the intended changes.</p>
