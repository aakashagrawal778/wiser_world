										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The last three weeks have been a roller coaster ride for individuals around the world, as the United States went in for an election and the outcome of Joe Biden’s victory has resulted in a complete and monumental mess. However, this was not the only event which made headlines. The news of Azerbaijan and Armenia inking a peace agreement, brokered mainly by the Russian Federation, grabbed the attention of the world. The waves of terrorism witnessed in the European States were another feature of what today can be defined as the new normal which the world seems to be being forced to accept. However, shrouded by this mist of uncertainty and amidst what can only be termed as anxious times, India has chosen to set out on a path of rebuilding its international relations in the post-COVID-19 world. This is highly evident through not only its participation but the active role it is playing in establishing a dialogue between nations that are a part of platforms such as the ASEAN and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p>



<h2><strong>15th East Asia Summit</strong></h2>



<p>The 15th round of the <a href="https://asean.org/chairmans-statement-15th-east-asia-summit/">East Asia Summit</a> was held on the 14th of November. The Indian Republic was represented by Dr. S. Jaishankar. The summit was chaired by the Prime Minister of Vietnam H.E Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who also serves as the chair of the ASEAN. The External Affairs Minister used the platform to reaffirm the importance of the East Asia Summit, while speaking about the need to adhere to international laws, respecting territorial integrity, and promoting a rule-based global order. His comments tie into India’s recent experience of a border skirmish with its Eastern neighbor, and at the same time, his comments shed light on the country’s plans. The importance that the Indo-Pacific holds for the Indian Subcontinent, was evident by Jaishankar’s remarks, where he referred to the region as an integrated and organic maritime space.</p>



<p>Jaishankar further expressed concerns about actions and decisions in the South China Sea that have led to an erosion of trust. While talking further about the South China Sea, he called for a joint initiative post the COVID 19 pandemic to tackle the challenges cutting across international boundaries such as terrorism, climate change, and the pandemic. Lastly, the discussion moved to the issue that the world has been continuously grappling with. Jaishankar in his remarks about the COVID 19 briefed the EAS leaders about India’s response to the pandemic and highlighted India’s efforts to support the international community. All nations present at the summit issued a joint call to keep all global supply chains open for an expeditious and sustainable economic recovery.</p>

<h2><strong>India-Italy Virtual Summit</strong></h2>



<p>A virtual bi-lateral summit, between the Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi and the Italian Prime Minister Prof. Giuseppe Conte was held on the 6th of November, 2020.

Lastly, on the multilateral level, both sides agree to coordinate closely at platforms such as G-20, to face global issues such as the COVID 19 and the economic downturn caused by the same.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>India in the last month has taken significant steps towards establishing an environment of mutual respect and peace, while trying to set initiative a dialogue in the region which can act as a potential check on increasing Chinese aggression. With there being a constant mention of the shared problem of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent news coming out regarding the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine, achieving 90% and 94.5% effectiveness, the country would have to focus on both production and distribution of the same if it is approved. Lastly, the next few months or even the coming years will be marked by a constant struggle aimed at economic recovery. It will be interesting to see how India’s strategic diplomatic ties help the country get back on its feet.</p>
