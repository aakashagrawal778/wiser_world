										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The joy of stepping into a new decade was soon quashed, as nations struggled to maintain political stability and carry on parliamentary work. The past week has been filled with geopolitical drama. Whether it be the United Kingdom officially leaving the European Union, which I am sure would have brought a smile to Charles De Gaulle, or whether it be a siege on the ‘Temple of Democracy’ itself. Of the many things one expected 2021 to behold, I am sure none expected such a dramatic start to the year. However, we as usual focus on what the Indian government is doing in the field of Foreign Policy.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Turkmenistan Foreign Office Consultations</strong></h2>



<p>Virtual <a href="http://www.businessworld.in/article/India-Turkmenistan-hold-foreign-office-consultations-discuss-economic-cooperation/13-01-2021-365212/">Foreign Consultations</a> between the Indian Republic and Turkmenistan was held on the 13th of January, 2021. The Indian delegation was led by Shri Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West), while the delegation from Turkmenistan was led by H.E Mr. Vepa Hajiyev, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.</p>



<p>The primary rationale behind the consultations was to undertake a systematic review of bilateral relations between the two countries. This included political, economic, commercial, defense, and consular cooperation. Both sides used the opportunity to exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interests and agreed to enhance cooperation in the United Nations and the multilateral arena.</p>



<h2><strong>3rd Senior Officials Meeting of Arab-India Cooperation Forum</strong></h2>



<p>On the 12th of January 2021, the third <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-arab-league-vow-to-deepen-cooperation-in-counter-terrorism/article33563866.ece">India-Arab Cooperation Forum</a> took place. The Forum meeting was co-chaired by Shri Sanjay Bhattacharyya, Secretary (CPV&amp;OIA), and Ambassador Mohamed Abu Al-Kheir, Assistant Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of Egypt to the League of Arab States with the participation of Senior Officials from the Arab States and India, as well as the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States.</p>



<p>The Representative hailed the strong foundation, great potential, and wide-ranging prospects for Arab-India cooperation. They also used the opportunity to recall the historic ties between the Arab world and India. Through the Forum, the leaders stressed the need for political solutions to regional issues and crisis in the Middle East, particularly the Palestinian issues, the crisis in Syria, Libya, and Yemen, and underscored the need for cooperation in combating terrorism and ensuring freedom of navigation and maritime security, according to the principles of international law.</p>



<p>The Arab side congratulated the Republic of India on its election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for a two-year term (2021-2022), while looking forward to India’s continuing pivotal role at the international stage, particularly concerning regional issues of mutual concern. They agreed on the early scheduling of the joint activities of the Forum, including the 3rd Session of Arab-India Cultural Festival, the Symposium on Arab-India Cooperation in the field of Energy, the 1st Arab-India University Presidents Conference, the 2nd</p>



<p>Symposium on Arab-India Cooperation in the field of Media, and the 6th Session of Arab-India Partnership Conference.</p>



<h2><strong>India and France hold Strategic Dialogue</strong></h2>



<p>Shri Ajit Doval, National Security Advisor, led the Indian delegation during the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/france-and-india-hold-strategic-dialogue/">India-France Strategic Dialogue</a>. The French delegation was led by Mr. Emmanuel Bonne, Diplomatic Advisor to the French President.</p>



<p>The Strategic dialogue between the two countries included discussions on a variety of issues including counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, defense cooperation, and the Indo-Pacific region. Both sides reaffirmed the high priority they accord to the India-France strategic partnership and highlighted the convergence of views between the two countries.</p>



<p>Following his meeting with Shri Ajit Doval, the French advisor called upon the Prime Minister, Shiri Narendra Modi, the Defence Minister, and the External Affairs Minister. He also addressed the Vivekananda International Foundation on &#8220;France and India: Partners for a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Germany Leaders&#8217; Video-Teleconference</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi held a video conference with his German counterpart, Federal Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel. The Prime Minister started the exchange by appreciating, Dr. Merkel’s long-standing role in providing stable and strong leadership at the European and global stage, and thanked her for strengthening the India-Germany Strategic Partnership.</p>



<p>The two leaders discussed key issues of mutual importance including the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, bilateral ties, regional and global issues, particularly India-EU relations. The Prime Minister used the opportunity to brief his German counterpart on the developments in India with regard to vaccine development and assured her of India’s commitment to using its capacity for the betterment of all countries.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister welcomed Germany’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and expressed his desire to further strengthen cooperation with Germany under the platform of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). The two heads of state agreed to hold the sixth Intergovernmental Consultations at an early date in 2021, and to create an ambitious agenda for the same, given that this year marks the 70th anniversary of setting up bilateral relations between India and Germany.</p>



<h2><strong>Exchange of list of prisoners between India and Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>Keeping with the provisions of the 2008 Agreement, The Indian Republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan exchanged lists of civilian prisoners and fishermen in their respective custody. The Indian government handed over a list of 263 Pakistani civilian prisoners and a list of 77 fishermen. The Pakistan government’s list included 49 Indian Civilians and a total of 270 fishermen, who according to the Islamic Republic are Indians or believed to be Indians.</p>



<p>Upon the exchange of lists, the Indian government asked to expedite the release and repatriation of 3 Indian civilian prisoners and 185 Indian fishermen, whose nationality has been confirmed and conveyed to Pakistan. Additionally, the Indian government has requested consular access to Indian fishermen and 22 civilians prisoners who are believed to be Indians. In keeping with the 2008 agreement, the Indian government requested access for Indian medical personnel to assess the mental conditions of the believed to be Indian prisoners.</p>



<p>At the exchange, the Indian government reaffirmed its priority towards all humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in both countries. In view of the COVID 19 pandemic, the Indian government requested the Pakistan government to ensure the safety, security, and welfare of all Indians and believed- to-be Indian civil prisoners and fishermen.</p>



<h2><strong>India Delivers Humanitarian Assistance &amp; Disaster Relief Support to Fiji after Tropical Cyclone Yasa</strong></h2>



<p>The Fiji islands were hit by a category 5 Tropical <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-humanitarian-assistance-disaster-relief-support-to-cyclone-hit-fiji/story-CjzaeQ4W4g8YCol8QOsuiP.html">Cyclone Yasa</a> in December. The Cyclone caused massive damage to the islands. In light of this natural calamity, the Indian government decided to provide humanitarian assistance through material aid. The relied material provided by the Indian government included shelter and hygiene kits, the government additionally also agreed to provide immediate assistance to the cyclone-affected communities.</p>



<p>A massive undertaking of this nature was possible owing to the work carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and were airlifted to the Fiji Islands, with the help of Air India and the Fiji Islands, through Sydney, Australia. India stood by Fiji during times of crisis and devastation, as this was not the first time that India provided the country assistance. Back in 2016, India was the leading nation to undertake humanitarian work on the islands following Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. India’s actions speak of its commitment to provide Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief support to friendly Foreign Countries as a first responder. India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific is in line with the Indo-Pacific Oceans initiative announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.</p>



<h2><strong>Telephone Conversation between Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of UK The Rt Hon Boris Johnson</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi conducted a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson appreciated the Indian government’s invitation to the Republic Day, but regretted his inability to attend, given the changed COVID 19 context in the UK.</p>



<p>The leaders reviewed ongoing cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi, congratulated Mr. Johnson and his government for achieving the</p>



<p>highest vaccination numbers in Europe. The two leaders agreed to cooperate in the near future to make the COVID 19 vaccines available for the world. Lastly, the heads of state reiterated their shared belief in the potential of the India-UK partnership in the post-Brexit, post-Covid context, and agreed to work towards a comprehensive roadmap for realizing this potential.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Keeping aside the boiling tensions in the United States, we have noted a trend in geopolitical actions, wherein states have adopted a more cooperative attitude. This is particularly true with India, as can be seen through the points that we have covered in the report. In the coming months, it would be interesting to see the nature of the relationship that the Indian government develops with the Biden- Harris administration, and this would affect its policies in the Indo-pacific and the Middle East.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the last few weeks, the Indian Republic has extended the reaches of its powers, by consulting and collaborating with several countries, ranging from the United Kingdom to the Russian Federation. The country has also established its commitment to the Afghanistan project while trying to fight to battle for global disarmament and non-proliferation through a partnership with the European Union. However, not all have been pleasant for the country, as recently the Ministry of External Affairs released a statement condemning the recent resolutions passed by the Organisation for the Islamic Conference. Lastly, through the report, we see that the External Affairs Minister travelled to several countries toward the end of November to review and further explore avenues to strengthen India’s Strategic Partnership with countries.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Russia consultation on UNSC issues</strong></h2>



<p>A delegation from the Indian Republic, being led by Shri Vikas Swarup, from the Ministry of External Affairs, met with a delegation being led by Mr. Sergey Vasilyevich Vershinin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. The consultations focused on India’s acceptance of the non-permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council. The Russian side appreciated India taking its place within the family of nations. Both sides focused on the agenda for the 2021-22 tenure. The Indian delegation along with emphasizing its commitment to deepen cooperation on counter-terrorism at multilateral platforms apprised the Russian delegation on its priorities. Lastly, the two countries decided to work closely together, given the common challenges faced and in keeping with their long-standing Special and Strategic Privileged Partnerships.</p>



<h2><strong>Unwarranted references to India in resolutions adopted by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference</strong></h2>



<p><strong><br></strong>On the 29th of November, the Ministry of External Affairs released a statement rejecting the references made to the Republic of India in the recent resolutions adopted by the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) at the 47th CFM session in Niamey, Republic of Niger. The ministry reinstated its belief that the Organisation for Islamic Conference has no locus standi in matters pertaining to domestic governance of the country, which also includes the highly volatile region of Jammu and Kashmir which the current government believes to be an integral and inalienable part of India. India expressed its contempt at the fact that the organization was being used by a country that itself has been under the spotlight numerous times in the past for religious tolerance, radicalism, and prosecution of minorities. The country finally delivered an ultimatum of sorts by suggesting that the Organisation for Islamic Conference refrain from making such unwarranted and factually incorrect references to India.</p>



<h2><strong>India- United Kingdom Dialogue</strong></h2>



<p>The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi spoke to His Excellency Mr. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on the 27th of November. The two leaders started their consultation by shedding light on the current situation in regards to COVID 19 in their specific countries and used the opportunity to promise cooperation between India and the UK in the area of vaccine development and manufacturing. The two leaders explored the possibility of further strengthening relations between the two countries, in areas related to trade and investment, scientific research, mobility of students and professionals, and defense and security. The two sides recalled their commitment to platforms like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure while agreeing that delegations from both countries should work towards creating a roadmap for the India-UK partnership.</p>



<h2><strong>India commitments at Afghanistan Conference 2020</strong></h2>



<p>The Afghanistan Conference, organized in Geneva, co-hosted by the United Nations, The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and the government of Finland, saw the participation of an Indian delegation, been led by S. Jaishankar. The External Affairs Minister announced at the conference that India had just concluded with Afghanistan an agreement for the construction of the Shatoot dam, which would provide safe drinking water to 2 million residents of Kabul city. India had earlier built the 202-km Phul-e-Khumri transmission line that provided</p>



<p>electricity to Kabul city. The Ministry of External Affairs recently also announced the launch of Phase-IV of the High Impact Community Development Projects in Afghanistan, which envisages more than 100 projects worth US$ 80 million that India would undertake in Afghanistan. In his statement, Jaishankar emphasized India’s long term commitment to the development of Afghanistan and the benefit of its people as a contiguous neighbour and strategic partner. The delegation also highlighted India’s efforts to provide alternate connectivity through Chabahar port and a dedicated Air Freight Corridor between India and Afghanistan. Lastly, Jaishankar voiced his concerns in regards to the increasing level of violence in Afghanistan and reiterated India’s call for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire.</p>



<h2><strong>India-EU consultation on disarmament and non-proliferation</strong></h2>



<p>The European Union and India held the sixth round of consultations on disarmament and non-proliferation. The consultation saw the sides exchange vital information on areas of nuclear, chemical, biological disarmament and non-proliferation, outer space security issues, strategic stability. Environment and other developments of mutual interest. The main aim of the consultations was to enhance mutual understanding and appreciation between India and the EU on international security issues.</p>



<h2><strong>4th NSA Level Meeting on Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian National Security Advisor Shri Ajit Doval, visited Colombo to participate in the 4th NSA Level Meeting on Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation. The meeting previously had been held in the Maldives in 2011, Sri Lanka in 2013, and India in 2014. The NSA level meetings have served as a platform for cooperation among Indian Ocean countries. Apart from the Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka and NSA Shri Ajit Doval from India, Defence Minister H.E. Mariya Didi will also participate in the meeting representing the Maldives. The meeting will provide an opportunity for discussion on issues pertaining to cooperation in maritime security in the Indian Ocean region. On the sidelines of the Trilateral Meeting, NSA is also expected to have other high-level bilateral engagements.</p>



<h2><strong>Bahrain, UAE, and Seychelles</strong></h2>



<p>External Affairs Minister, Dr. S.Jaishankar undertook a visit to Bahrain, UAE, and Seychelles from the 24th to the 29th of November, during which he met his counterparts and the leaders of the countries. Jaishankar’s visit to Bahrain is his first to the country since he took on the role as External Affairs Minister of India. Jaishakar used the opportunity to convey condolences on behalf of the Government of India and the people of India to the Bahrininin leadership on the demise of Prime Minister HH Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. The Minister will hold talks with the Bahrain leadership on bilateral issues as well as regional and international issues of mutual interest.</p>



<p>The External Affairs Minister visited the United Arab Emirates next, during which he met the Foreign Minister of UAE, HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. During the interaction between the two leaders, they focused on taking forward the excellent cooperation between Indian and the United Arab Emirates under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The meeting reached a productive outcome as the two leaders were able to discuss ways in which Indian workers could resume their jobs in the UAE, as more than 3 million Indians live and work in the country. India and the UAE have maintained close contact during the pandemic. Prime Minister Modi has spoken to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during the pandemic. The two heads of state also co-chaired the India-UAEJoint Commission Meeting in September 2020.</p>



<p>Lastly, Jaishankar visited the Republic of Seychelles on the 27th and the 28th of November 2020. The Foreign Affairs Minister met with the newly elected President, H.E. MR. Wavel Ramkalawan to present greetings of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and discussed with him what the priorities for the Indian government are and focused on exploring new areas and avenues for strengthening India-Seychelles bilateral relations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The last three weeks have been a roller coaster ride for individuals around the world, as the United States went in for an election and the outcome of Joe Biden’s victory has resulted in a complete and monumental mess. However, this was not the only event which made headlines. The news of Azerbaijan and Armenia inking a peace agreement, brokered mainly by the Russian Federation, grabbed the attention of the world. The waves of terrorism witnessed in the European States were another feature of what today can be defined as the new normal which the world seems to be being forced to accept. However, shrouded by this mist of uncertainty and amidst what can only be termed as anxious times, India has chosen to set out on a path of rebuilding its international relations in the post-COVID-19 world. This is highly evident through not only its participation but the active role it is playing in establishing a dialogue between nations that are a part of platforms such as the ASEAN and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p>



<h2><strong>15th East Asia Summit</strong></h2>



<p>The 15th round of the <a href="https://asean.org/chairmans-statement-15th-east-asia-summit/">East Asia Summit</a> was held on the 14th of November. The Indian Republic was represented by Dr. S. Jaishankar. The summit was chaired by the Prime Minister of Vietnam H.E Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who also serves as the chair of the ASEAN. The External Affairs Minister used the platform to reaffirm the importance of the East Asia Summit, while speaking about the need to adhere to international laws, respecting territorial integrity, and promoting a rule-based global order. His comments tie into India’s recent experience of a border skirmish with its Eastern neighbor, and at the same time, his comments shed light on the country’s plans. The importance that the Indo-Pacific holds for the Indian Subcontinent, was evident by Jaishankar’s remarks, where he referred to the region as an integrated and organic maritime space.</p>



<p>Jaishankar further expressed concerns about actions and decisions in the South China Sea that have led to an erosion of trust. While talking further about the South China Sea, he called for a joint initiative post the COVID 19 pandemic to tackle the challenges cutting across international boundaries such as terrorism, climate change, and the pandemic. Lastly, the discussion moved to the issue that the world has been continuously grappling with. Jaishankar in his remarks about the COVID 19 briefed the EAS leaders about India’s response to the pandemic and highlighted India’s efforts to support the international community. All nations present at the summit issued a joint call to keep all global supply chains open for an expeditious and sustainable economic recovery.</p>



<h2><strong>17th ASEAN Summit</strong></h2>



<p>India was represented at the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-17th-asean-india-summit-a-turning-point-of-asean-india-relations-in-post-covid-world/articleshow/79173959.cms">ASEAN</a> by Prime Minister, Mr. Modi. The ASEAN Summit was chaired by H.E. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the Prime Minister of Vietnam. In his opening remarks, the Indian Prime Minister chose to shed light on the importance of ASEAN, by highlighting its centrality to India’s Act East Policy. The Prime Minister underscored the importance of strengthening convergence between India&#8217;s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook on Indo- Pacific, to ensure a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.</p>



<p>The Indian delegation to further cooperation with ASEAN nations reiterated India’s broader support to the international community and extended an offer to contribute US$ 1 million to the ASEAN COVID 19 Response Fund. The Prime Minister further talked about the importance of greater physical and digital connectivity between ASEAN and India and repeated India&#8217;s offer of a US$ 1 billion Line of Credit to support ASEAN connectivity. Lastly, the heads of state and international leaders present at the Summit, while recognizing India’s contribution to the peace and stability in the region, decided to adopt the new ASEAN-India Plan of Action for 2021-2025. The member states present insisted on the significance of keeping up and advancing harmony, dependability, wellbeing, and security in the South China Sea and guaranteeing opportunity of route and overflight.</p>



<h2><strong>20th Summit of SCO Council of Heads of State</strong></h2>



<p>The 20th Summit of the <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1671756%23:~:text=20th%20Summit%20of%20SCO%20Council%20of%20Heads%20of%20State%20was,Modi%20led%20the%20Indian%20delegation.">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> was held on the 10th of November in a virtual format. India was represented by the Prime Minister, while the Summit was being chaired by the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. The Summit was attended by an array of partners, that comprised the Secretary-General of the SCO Secretariat, Executive Director of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, and the President of the four Observer States of the SCO, which includes: Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran, and Mongolia.</p>



<p>This was the third meeting that the Indian Delegation attended, since becoming a fully participating member of the SCO back in 2017. The Prime Minister used the forum to intimate other members of India’s plan in the United Nations, as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Modi emphasized India’s plans to focus on the theme of ‘reformed multilateralism’ to bring about desirable changes in global governance.</p>



<p>Further, the Prime Minister made known the country’s firm belief in regional peace, security, and prosperity and its future ambitions of raising a voice against terrorism, smuggling of illegal weapons, drugs, and money laundering. In terms of strengthening the Republic’s relationship with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Member nations, the Indian Delegating reflected on India’s strong cultural and historical connection with the SCO region and reiterated India’s firm commitment towards strengthening connectivity in the region with initiatives like International North-South Transport Corridor, Chabahar Port, and Ashgabat Agreement.</p>



<p>In his concluding remarks, the Indian Prime Minster expressed his willingness to host the next regular meetings of the SCO Council of Heads of Government on the 30th of November. Lastly, the Indian Prime Minister congratulated President Emomali Rahmon of the Republic of Tajikistan for taking up the chairmanship of the SCO next year and assured full cooperation from India’s end.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Mexico Meeting</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian External Affairs Minister met with H.E. Ambassador Ernesto Araujo, the External Relations Minister for Brazil. The Indian Delegation started the talks by conveying their condolences to the Brazilian families who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks in France. The Ministers discussed opportunities for cooperation in the post-COVID world and emphasized the importance of Brazil-India cooperation in terms of economic recovery efforts, healthcare, cybersecurity, and supply chain resilience. The Ministers also discussed a wide range of regional and multilateral issues especially in the context of India’s upcoming membership of the UNSC, the role of G4, and India’s priorities in the UNSC.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Italy Virtual Summit</strong></h2>



<p>A virtual bi-lateral summit, between the Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi and the Italian Prime Minister Prof. Giuseppe Conte was held on the 6th of November, 2020. Recalling the Italian Prime Minister’s visit to India two years ago, Mr. Modi appreciated the rapid strengthening of India- Italy relations. The summit acted as a common platform for the two leaders to review their bi-lateral frameworks and discuss a wide range of issues including political, scientific, and defence technology. Lastly, on the multilateral level, both sides agree to coordinate closely at platforms such as G-20, to face global issues such as the COVID 19 and the economic downturn caused by the same.</p>



<h2><strong>Removal of Sudan from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism and normalization of relations with Israel</strong></h2>



<p><strong><br></strong>On the 9th of November, the External Affairs Ministry released a statement, declaring that Sudan has been removed from the list of countries that are sponsors of terrorism. The Ministry acknowledged that the Indian-Sudanese relations are historic and special and forged based on shared values. The Indian Government also congratulated the Transitional Government and the people of Sudan on the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement, and hope that these positive developments will usher in democratic changes and contribute to enhancing Sudan’s development, peace, security, and stability.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>India in the last month has taken significant steps towards establishing an environment of mutual respect and peace, while trying to set initiative a dialogue in the region which can act as a potential check on increasing Chinese aggression. With there being a constant mention of the shared problem of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent news coming out regarding the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine, achieving 90% and 94.5% effectiveness, the country would have to focus on both production and distribution of the same if it is approved. Lastly, the next few months or even the coming years will be marked by a constant struggle aimed at economic recovery. It will be interesting to see how India’s strategic diplomatic ties help the country get back on its feet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Diasporas in the recent times have emerged as powerful entities in the realm of ‘soft power’ foreign policy strategy and as an agent or catalyst of economic development in the countries of origin apart from their active role in the host countries. Diasporas have a unique role in international relations and foreign policy because they act as a link between two countries, “sharing in two cultures, having an emotional investment in two nations, and preserving social connections in two societies.”</p>



<p>Due to the globalisation and liberalisation of global economies coupled with the rapid advancement in science and communication technologies, there has been an intensification of their socio-economic, political and cultural ties with their countries of origin. Diasporas have attained due importance at the international level as well as in the domestic political and economic affairs of home countries in the present scenario. <mark>They have started acting as an ‘inevitable link’ between their home and host lands resulting in major political and economic implications for both.</mark></p>



<h3>Diaspora as a Tool of Diplomacy in India&#8217;s Foreign Policy</h3>



<p>The use of diaspora as a tool of diplomacy in Indian Foreign Policy is a relatively new phenomenon. The Indian diaspora is a major component of these concomitant worldwide and has increasingly become more influential over India’s foreign policy, becoming a highly strategic asset for India in the recent decades. India has been making concerted efforts to engage and leverage upon its diaspora estimated to be about 25 million, the second largest in the world, ranging from a mere 20 in Albania to over 2.2 million in the United States, dispersed in 136 countries.</p>

<p>The efforts of PM Modi regarding Diaspora Diplomacy and in cultivating the relationship with Indian diaspora signifies the importance of soft power in the foreign policy initiatives of the present government. To be fair, diaspora cultivation is not exactly a new phenomenon in IFP; the former governments had also invested a good amount of capital in resolving the underlying obstacles in the implementation of effective interaction between Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) with the Indian government.  </p>



<p>The union government in the year 2000 established a high-level committee on Indian diaspora to review the status of People of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) looking at the laws and rules that are applicable to them. This was an initiative to look at the role NRIs and PIOs may play in the social, economic and technological development of India.&nbsp; Better rules favouring the PIOs like the ease of travel and stay were implemented and new categories created amongst its diaspora in 2006 for the NRIs, PIOs and Overseas Citizen of India (OCIs). The Indian parliament in August 2005, passed the amendment of Citizenship Act of 1955, allowing certain sections of the diaspora to gain specific citizenship rights. Eventually, there is a growth in outreach activities for the Indian diaspora like conferences and seminars, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (Day of Indians Abroad) amongst other initiatives which show a concerted effort by the Government of India to showcase India as a place that is welcoming of its diaspora.</p>



<h3>Diasporas: Effective Instrument in India&#8217;s Foreign Policy</h3>



<p>The importance of diasporas does not end with remittances alone. It extends to knowledge transfer, the sharing of resources, diasporas acting as unofficial Indian ambassadors and pushing for India&#8217;s interests abroad. The diaspora has also helped in improving India’s image globally and they undoubtedly have considerable stakes in India’s development.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Diaspora is the oxygen to PM Modi’s foreign policy. Since day one, he has addressed concerns related to the Indian diaspora and makes it a point to address a gathering of Indian diaspora at any foreign visit. The task of such an interaction is to convince the diaspora that they can engage as effective stakeholders in the problems faced by India and that their contribution is imperative for India’s economic development and its rise as a global power. This also acts as a subtle but powerful message to the governments of the host countries. This “Diaspora Diplomacy” is a classic example of how the diaspora can act as an effective instrument of diplomacy in international affairs in the era of globalisation. The diaspora can greatly contribute to domestic economic development and attract FDI to India. Modi’s idea of diaspora diplomacy is to ensure a collective Indian voice in the host countries where they are simultaneously loyal citizens. While the diaspora certainly do not determine policy, they can effectively shape it and act as “bridge-builders” between their home and host countries.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="787" height="720" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.23.50-AM-min.jpeg" alt="Top Remittance Receiver (2017)" class="wp-image-3682" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.23.50-AM-min.jpeg 787w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.23.50-AM-min-300x274.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.23.50-AM-min-768x703.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><figcaption><em>Source:</em> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/how-the-matrix-of-remittances-is-changing-for-indians/articleshow/64809196.cms?from=mdr"><em>The Economic Times</em></a></figcaption></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>While looking at the effect of diaspora Diplomacy in Indian Foreign Policy, some examples can be cited as diaspora plays a decisive role in the improvement of India’s foreign relations. Historically, India has benefitted from its diaspora. Two instances stand out: lobbying for the US-India Civilian Nuclear Agreement Bill in 2008 and their remittance inflow. The Indo-American community had a significant role to play in improving the image of Indians in the American minds as well as the Indo-US rapprochement. The lobbying efforts of the US India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) helped to get the Indo-US Nuclear Deal passed by the US Congress. While Bollywood films since Independence have enjoyed great popularity in the Middle East, the development of geo-economics has made the Indian diaspora as an important instrument, interest and indicator of India’s soft power in the region. The Indian expats working in the region contribute significantly to the remittances India receives. PM Modi has capitalised on the need for Middle Eastern countries to look for large markets because of the Shale Revolution and US Retrenchment, increasing India’s engagement with the region. The most important tool for PM Modi’s Middle East adventures has been the Indian diaspora.</p>



<p>However, certain political developments taking place within India do sometimes negatively impact the diaspora, for example, the negative impact of the diaspora is that there are also groups and individuals within the diaspora who continue to support various insurgent groups operating within India, while lending them both moral and material support through hawala operations, money laundering etc. and this can prove to be a colossal security threat for the nation.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, India has a pivotal role to play in world affairs as it is a rising power and a key stakeholder in the security dynamics of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Its role in East Asia is taking shape and while India is still not an economic power, its military capabilities, shared interests and willingness to explore beyond its rhetoric have raised expectations banking on its capabilities and the role India can play as an Asian power, in the region and globally. The large populations of Indian expatriates in countries like Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia provide India with an opportunity to develop nurturing and more cooperative relations in the region. In the past, diaspora policies have been inconsistent and often poorly implemented, to say in the least. Over the years, however, the diaspora populations have become an increasingly important factor in international relations and politics. The Indian diaspora have a direct engagement and influence on the economies and polities of both the origin country and the host country. This provides for a ripe environment for India to tap on the potential they offer.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>However, the present foreign-policy strategy of a strong outreach to the Indian diaspora stands out and must be nurtured. The diaspora can provide the requisite strategic impulse and strengthen strategic relations. &nbsp;In the present times, the global reach of media and revolutionary changes in communication has helped create diaspora networks and instant connectivity with the motherland. It is important to constantly engage the diaspora and develop policies as the destinies of India and the diaspora are intertwined. Therefore, it serves the interest of both to develop a mutually beneficial relationship and is an important tool for India’s soft power diplomacy which would help India in achieving its aspirations to be a developed country and a knowledge superpower in the international arena.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy</strong>&nbsp;— The piping tensions between the two neighbours, India and China were further cooled with the country taking part in the India-China Military Commander-Level Meeting, which resulted in the issuing of a joint press release. India was also party to the India-Russia-China meetings that led to the creation of the Five Point Solution for the border conflict. With the Indian and Chinese relations finally experiencing a detente of sorts, the country has been able to focus its attention on issues further than its territorial borders. India’s resolve to increase its presence in the Indo-Pacific and to ensure the creation of a free and fair region, was further strengthened, owing to the 2nd India-Australia-Japan-USA Ministerial meeting. Lastly, the country used the international platform to make known its views on the issue of cross border and internal terrorism.</p>



<h2>Some major updates to cover in today’s Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:</h2>



<h4><strong>Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of Victims of Terrorism</strong></h4>



<p>The Republic of India recently participated in the Ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of <a href="https://www.indiaties.in/7922/ministerial-meeting-of-the-group-of-friends-of-victims-of-terrorism/">Victims of Terrorism</a>. The Indian delegation was led by Smt. Vijay Thakur Singh, Ministry of External Affairs. The virtual meeting began with the Indian Secretary conveying a word of gratitude to the Foreign Ministers of Spain and Afghanistan respectively, Co-Chairs of the group and also to the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) for organising the meeting. The Secretary then went onto underscore the importance of dealing with terrorism as an international problem rather than an individual domestic one.

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The world that we inhabit today is very different from the one that we experienced just over a year ago. Not only have we been dealing with an existential crisis at hand in the form of the COVID 19 pandemic, but as we step into a new decade of the 21st century, we find chaos and confusion governing the four corners of the world, with the coups in countries like Mali and the pitiable state that countries like Nigeria are in. However, the most anticipated event of the year, the US presidential elections are in a fortnight, and it’ll definitely be interesting to see how they shape global politics in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy</strong>&nbsp;— As citizens globally find themselves slightly relieved with the easing of restrictions in several countries and finally a little ray of hope shining brightly over the socio-economic horizon as the national governments start finally projecting a clarity of action in regards to combating the pandemic, we find our selves dealing with the same vexed situations, like those in the pre-pandemic days. Then whether it be the never-ending instability in the Middle-East, with the Syrian refugees facing disastrous and inhuman circumstances in their host countries and the re-emergence of political upheaval in countries like Mali, which is currently undergoing a coup. With so much happening over and above the pandemic, India, which is the last year and a half has projected itself as a regional power, acting as a bulwark against the rising aggression by the Chinese Republic, is trying it utmost to increase its engagement outside of its traditional realms of geopolitical influence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Some major updates to cover in today’s Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:</h2>



<h4><strong>17th India-Vietnam Joint Commission Meeting</strong></h4>



<p>India recently took a momentous step, by strengthening its bilateral relations with the Republic of Vietnam through the 17th India-Vietnam Joint Commission Meeting, centred around trade, economic, scientific, and technological cooperation. The meeting was co-chaired by DR. S. Jaishakar, External Affairs Minister for the Indian Republic, and H.E. Mr Pham Binh Minh, who currently serves as both the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The meeting had two major outcomes. Within the realms of Economic and Social developments, the two representatives discussed the recent progress in the India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was further aided by a discussion about the regional and international spheres of interest for the two countries. The External Affairs Ministry placed special emphasis on Prime Minister Modi’s vision of an Atmanirbhar Bharat, which focuses on self-reliance and human-centric globalization. The ministry also reasserted India’s willingness to assist Vietnam, through initiatives such as the Quick impact Projects, ITEC, PhD fellowships, and projects in water resource management. The second aspect that the two counties focused on was, strengthening their defence engagements, in line with India’s recent policy ion increasing military presence in the region. To further reinforce India’s presence at the United Nations Security Council, both countries agreed to work and collaborate closely. Lastly, the two countries decided to structure their cooperation and bilateral engagements, in line with India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and ASEAN’s outlook on the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>India-Uzbekistan Joint Projects</strong></h4>



<p>The first meeting of the National Coordination Committee of India-Uzbekistan Joint Projects was held on the 24th of the August, under the chairmanship of Mr Sardor Umurzakov, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Investments and Foreign Trade, who was assisted by the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri V. Muraleedharan. The bilateral meet was organized with the aim to review the joint projects between the two countries, which were essentially implemented under the direction of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Uzbek President Mr Shavkat Mirziyoyev. The representatives extensively reviewed the current agreements and planned out future activities in terms of economic and trade cooperation. During the meeting, special attention was paid to the status of negotiations for concluding a Bilateral Investment Treaty, and granting mutual market access for agricultural products from both countries. There was a general sense of satisfaction and hope conveyed by the two chairs, on the current status of the projects, and the strength the completion of the same would add to the bilateral relations between the two countries. Minister of State Shri V. Muraleedharan extended an invitation to Deputy Prime Minister Mr Umurzakov to visit India as per mutual convenience.</p>



<h4><strong>Statement on Foreign Secretary’s visit to Dhaka</strong></h4>



<p>The Indian Foreign Secretary, Shri Harsh Wandhan Shringla visited Bangladesh last month. The trip carried with it significant diplomatic importance. The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s visit started off with discussions regrinding the upcoming celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Bangladeshi independence and the establishment of ties between the two neighbours. The Indian delegation also chose to use the trip to highlight the assistance provided by New Delhi to Dhaka, in combating the COVID-19 and how India organized capacity-building courses for the Bangladeshi Medical Personnel, following the conference of SAARC leaders and the meeting up of the SAARC Emergency Response Fund for COVID 19. India also used the platform to announce its intentions to launch an air bubble, to resume travel between the two nations, and propose to convene a meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission at the level of Foreign Ministers, to review all the joint projects being undertaken. Lastly, the meeting recorded discussions for the safe repatriation of displaced persons from troubled regions of the Rakhine state and looked into further strengthening defence cooperation, to bring an effective stop to cross border crime. The visit of the Foreign secretary turned out to be highly beneficial for the two countries, especially for India, given its ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Diplomatic Appointments</strong></h4>



<p>Shri Shambhu S. Kumaran, who currently serves as the Ambassador of the Indian Republic to the Republic of Philippines has been appointed as the country’s Ambassador to both the Republic of Palau and The federal States of Micronesia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Seeing the increasing Indian footprint on the international political and socio-economic map,&nbsp; one can only say that the country will have a dominant role to play in shaping the world order post the pandemic. In particular, India has focused mainly on its neighbourhood, as highlighted through its ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’ and the ‘Act East Policy’. During this time of uncertainty, it is India’s ability to achieve rapid and sustainable development that will ensure the country a place at the table along with the big boys. India&#8217;s Indo-Pacific vision epitomizes its desire of being a &#8220;main force&#8221;. All things being equal, it is simply the start of a decadal venture, which will see India shoulder the desires that befit the world&#8217;s biggest popularity based economy. To do this, Delhi should continually reconsider the elements of progress in progress, picture the potential outcomes that are on offer, envision the chaperon dangers and creator the new request emerging out of Asia.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy</strong> — In the last week, India has taken substantial strides in its strategic bilateral relations. The exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases has not deterred the country from following through on its agenda. In the last two months, the country has found itself at loggerheads with the Chinese Red Dragon over the border issues at the Galwan Valley, which led to a spate of talks between the Special Representatives and the army personnel. As India’s relations with China in the East soured, its relations with Pakistan in the West, experienced no such events that would taint the relations any further. In fact, the two countries exchanged a prisoners list on the 1st of July, under the 2008 agreement. However, in an unprovoked breach of the ceasefire by Pakistan, the Indians recently incurred a loss of civilian lives. Lastly, Mr Narendra Modi’s address at the United Nations Economic and Social Council is much looked forward to and caps an eventful week in India. </p>



<h2>Some major updates to cover in today&#8217;s Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:</h2>



<h4><strong>United Nations Economic and Social Council</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">On the 75th anniversary of the United Nations <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-addresses-united-nations-first-time-since-india-s-election-to-unsc-10-points-1701724-2020-07-17">ECOSOC</a>, this week, the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi delivered the keynote address at the virtual gathering. This happened to be the second time, that Mr Modi had the opportunity to address the council, as he had delivered the keynote address back when the council was celebrating its 70th anniversary in the year 2015. However, this does happen to be the first opportunity the Prime Minister has had to address the gathering of member nations since India was overwhelmingly elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The summit was themed around Multilateralism post- COVID-19 and the kind of United Nations we need on the 75th anniversary.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">During the address, the Prime Minister called for a reformed multilateralism with a reformed United Nations at its centre. He also stressed on India’s motto, ‘Sabkasaath, Sabkavikaas, Sabkavishwas’, that resonated with the SDG principle of leaving no one behind. The Prime Minister also used this opportunity to reflect on India’s perseverance in improving the socio-economic situation in the country. On that note, he said, “While marching forward on the path to development, we are not forgetting our responsibility towards our planet.” In terms of India’s effort in battling the virus, the Prime Minister praised the system in place by commenting, “Our grassroots health system is helping India attain one of the best recovery rates around the world, in the fight against COVID.”</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A large majority of the Prime Minister’s speech revolved around International cooperation and India’s role and partnership with the ECOSOC and other international bodies. The present member states, made note of a significant impact on the global SDGs, due to India’s contribution to the improvement of socio-economic conditions and the support it provided to other developing countries. The Prime Minister also focussed on the role of the first responder that India has been carrying out in the region an example of which would be, India’s Operation Sagar, carried out in the Indian Ocean Region to provide both material and medical assistance to countries. Lastly, the Prime Minister spoke about the importance of financial inclusion and the necessity of providing housing and healthcare, by giving the example of the on-going development efforts in India, especially the ‘Swacch Bharat Abhiyan’ campaign.</p>



<h4><strong>Indo-Pak Relation</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Relations between the two neighbours; India and Pakistan experienced a new low in the last few days as the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mea-summons-pakistans-charge-daffaires-after-two-indian-officials-go-missing/articleshow/76386657.cms">Charge d&#8217;Affairs</a> of Pakistan was summoned by the Indian Government, following an unprovoked ceasefire violation by Pakistani forces on the night of the 17th of July, 2020 in the</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Krishna Ghati Sector in Jammu and Kashmir. Keeping in mind the soaring number of ceasefire violations by Pakistan which have resulted in the death of 21 Indians and have injured close to 94 civilians, has pushed India to strongly condemn the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by the Pakistani forces. The Indian Government has also seized this opportunity to show their contempt at the subvert and continued Pakistani support for cross border terrorist infiltration into India. India has called upon Pakistan to adhere to the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding between the two countries, which requires them both to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control and the international border.</p>



<h4><strong>India Ideas Summit</strong></h4>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/32841/PMs_address_at_India_Ideas_Summit_2020">The India Ideas Summit</a>, being organized by the India-US Business Council, which is celebrating its 45th anniversary, had the prime Minister deliver the keynote address. The theme of this year&#8217;s summit is ‘Building a Better Future’. The summit essentially aims at developing a strategic working relationship between the United States and the Indian Republic. The summit will include both Indian and American government policymakers and state-level officials. Minister of External Affairs, Dr S Jaishankar, U.S Secretary of State Mr Mike Pompeo, Senator of Virginia and the co-chair of the Indian Caucus, Mr Mark Warner and the U.S ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Nikki Haley will be among those attending the summit. The summit essentially aims to discuss India-US cooperation and the relations between the two countries in a post COVID world.</p>



<h4><strong>India-Spain Foreign Office Consultations</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India this week was a part of the 6th <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32843/IndiaSpain_Foreign_Office_Consultations">Foreign Office consultation with Spain</a>, held on the 21st of July. The Indian delegation was led by Mr Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West). Meanwhile, the Spanish side had, Ms Cristina Gallach, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ibero-America, and the Caribbean, at its helm. The two countries along with discussing reforms and opportunities for enhancing bilateral economic cooperation exchanged views on the COVID 19 response and post- COVID recovery priorities. Lastly, the two sides revised agreements under consideration and mutually agreed to forward the bilateral agenda, including exchange by both sides.</p>



<h4><strong>Release of Nidan Singh Sachdeva</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center" style="grid-template-columns:auto 43%"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="962" height="541" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1.jpeg" alt="INDIA’S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT - EDITION #3" class="wp-image-2437 size-full" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1.jpeg 962w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was kidnapped last month from the Chamkani district in Pakita province on 22nd June 2020, was recently released from captivity. Nidan Singh belongs to the Hindu-Sikh community of Afghanistan. The Indian Government conveyed its appreciation to the Government of Afghanistan and various tribal leaders of the region for their help. The kidnapping of Nidan Singh has revealed the ongoing targeting and persecution of minority members by terrorists who are controlled by their external supporters. Lastly, in a decisive measure, India has decided to facilitate the return of those minority members who face external security threats.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Even though the country is experiencing a worsening of conditions with its neighbours, keeping in mind the recent development of tensions with Pakistan, over the unprovoked fire at the Line of Control, the country has extended a helping hand towards both nations like Afghanistan in the Middle East and at the same time European nations such as Spain. In the last few years the country has developed military relations with the United States, but in recent times it has looked at the possibility of venturing into developing an economic partnership with the superpower. Lastly, India’s image as developing power worldwide has been further augmented by its election into the United Nations Security Council and the keynote address delivered by the Prime Minister at the Economic and Social Council.</p>

<p>The year has been scarred by one of the most significant events of the century. The COVID-19 virus has disrupted more lives than the two World Wars combined. Despite the severity of the disease and the grave threat that it poses, India has faced the virus on a war footing, doing the utmost it can at home and simultaneously following a rigorous foreign policy to ensure a global approach to the problem at hand and any such conceivable problems in the future. Some major updates to cover in today’s<mark> Foreign Policy</mark>&nbsp;Report are as follow:</p>



<h3><strong>India-US, Foreign Office Consultations</strong></h3>



<p>Historically, India has always chosen to tread the neutral path when it has been faced with the decision of choosing a side in geopolitics, especially during the Nehruvian years, that is immediately after it attained independence, where it followed a strict policy of non-alignment. However, in recent times as India has chosen to increase its influence and emerge as an important geopolitical leader in the South-Asian region, it has substantially increased its cooperation and strengthened its ties with the United States. The latest developments between the two nations include a set of <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-india-foreign-office-consultations-2/">Foreign Office Consultations</a>. The virtual meeting took place between the Foreign Secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, and the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, David Hale. Given the current situation where the virus is surging by leaps and bounds in both countries, the two representatives agreed to further strengthen the health partnership, including in the areas of pharmaceuticals and vaccine development. </p>



<p>They further agreed to ensure the enhancement of mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties. During this discussion, the Indian delegation addressed the issues regarding the VISA facilitation post-COVID, especially keeping in mind professionals and students. Following this, the two representatives moved on to address the elephant in the room, the Indo-Pacific, that has come to be seen as one of the most strategically important regions in the world, with 75% of world trade passing through the region. Keeping in mind India’s geographic proximity to the region and the US’ trade and military interests, both nations have persevered in the past to ensure a free open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, against China’s predatory approach. The following consultation acted as a testimony to India-US joint initiatives in the Indo-Pacific in the future. Lastly, the United States emphasised the US-India cooperation in the United Nation, especially after India was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the year 2020-21.</p>



<h3><strong>India-European Union Summit</strong></h3>



<p>India’s increased engagement in the Western Indian Ocean regions has led to the country cooperating and investing in strategic relationships with several European Nations. The 15th meeting of the <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32817/IndiaEuropean_Union_Summit">India-European Union</a> summit is scheduled to be held virtually. The meeting was co-chaired by the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, the President of the European Union, H.E Charles, and the President of the European Commission, H.E Ursula Von Der Leyen. The summit that is to be held in the coming days will mainly focus on India-EU cooperation covering political and security relations and at the same time will look into avenues of trade and investment. The summit would mainly be addressing the issues of development during the COVID 19 pandemic and contemporary global matters.</p>



<h3><strong>Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border Affairs</strong></h3>



<p>India has been locking horns with the Chinese Republic over several issues. Most recent of these has been the border situation, at the Galwan Valley. On the 10th of July, 2020. The 16th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/india-china-border-standoff-long-road-ahead-next-wmcc-to-take-place-soon/2020446/">India-China Border Affairs</a> was held. The Indian delegation was led by the Joint Secretary (East Asia) from the Ministry of External Affairs. Meanwhile, the Chinese delegation was led by the Director-General of the Boundary and Oceanic Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Before deliberating over the future steps in regards to the de-escalation in violence at the border regions, the two delegations looked back at the agreements between the two nations. The first of these agreements were between the two foreign ministers on the 17th of June, following which there was an agreement reached between special representatives on the 5th of July. The recent consultation essentially reviewed the situation at the India-China border including the progress made in terms of the ongoing disengagement of troops. It was decided that another meeting of the WMCC will be conducted in the future, followed by a meeting of the Senior Commanders, which will discuss further steps to ensure a complete disengagement and de-escalation in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>High-Level Summit of the United Nations Economic and Social Council</strong></h3>



<p>The Prime Minister recently delivered the keynote address at a high-level summit of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on the 17th of July. PM Narendra Modi had previously addressed the member nations of the council in 2016 at the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ecosoc-address-pm-modi-pitches-for-un-reforms-during-says-it-should-reflect-today-s-realities-1701702-2020-07-17">ECOSOC</a>. This time around the Prime Minister delivered his address at the Valedictory session, where he was joined by the Prime Minister of Norway and the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The summit attracted a diverse set of representatives from several nations. The Conference that celebrated the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, bears the theme of ‘Multilateralism after COVID 19: What kind of United Nations do we need at the 75th anniversary’. The session that primarily focused on bolstering leadership through global cooperation and international institutions, was the first opportunity the Indian Prime Minister had to address member nations since India got elected to the United Nations Security Council. The Summit acts to India’s advantage as it aligns with India’s Security Council priority, wherein India has emphasised the need for reformed multilateralism in a post-COVID-19 world. The session also recalled India’s role as a holder of the inaugural Presidency of the Economic and Social Council.</p>

<h3><strong>International Appointments</strong></h3>



<p>Jawed Ashraf, the Indian Ambassador to the French Republic has been concurrently accredited as the Ambassador to Principality of Monaco. At the same time Dr Vidya P Nair, who currently serves as a Director in the Ministry of External Affairs, has been designated as the next Ambassador to Turkmenistan. Lastly, Shri Hemant Harishchandra Kotalwar, presently Joint Secretary on deputation to NCSC has recently taken up the position of the next Ambassador to the Czech Republic.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>India has for long followed an inward-facing forward policy, that did not prioritise bilateral relations and strategic partnerships and adopted a neutral stance on geopolitical matters. However, that is not the case anymore. With the given situation that the country finds itself in regards to the Chinese Republic, and the leadership position it has assumed after the Indian Prime Minister addressed nations at the Shangri-La dialogue, India has further increased its relations with European Nations and further strengthened its bilateral relations with the United States, to an extent where India has been promoted to the status, generally granted to treaty allies. With India’s burgeoning interest in geopolitics, India’s current foreign policy decisions will shape the position it assumes in the post-pandemic world order.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy</strong> — For the first half of the year, countries worldwide have concentrated their undivided attention in fighting the COVID-19 world pandemic. This blight hasn’t limited its influence on medicine and health, it has significantly altered several sectors. One such being ‘Diplomacy’. We have noticed an increase in the importance of being given to policies, which had otherwise taken a back seat during the pre-pandemic days. With a majority of countries being under lockdown, restrictions in air travel and a sharp economic downturn are the commonalities seen as never before. The pandemic has paved the way for a new form of diplomacy, one that has permitted nations to act with lightning speed and create an environment of cooperation within their respective regions. </p>



<h2>Some major updates to cover in today&#8217;s  Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:</h2>



<h4><strong>India’s Mission Sagar in the Indian Ocean Region</strong></h4>



<p>With that spirit in mind, India has recently launched, ‘Mission Sagar’ on the 10th of May. The mission is India’s way of assisting nations in the Indian Ocean Region, in their fight against COVID-19. In this mission, assistance was provided by the <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32803/MISSION_SAGAR_A_major_Milestone_in_Indias_Engagement_with_IOR_Countries">INS Kesari</a>, that sailed to the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros, and Seychelles, to deliver material assistance and in particular, medical assistance to Mauritius and Comoros. The successful completion of the mission can be seen as a major milestone, in terms of India’s new foreign policy of increased engagement in the Indo-Pacific and the Western Sectors of the Indian Ocean. The mission is also in line with the Prime Minister’s policy of SAGAR (Security and Growth for all in the Region). Mission Sagar is one particular example of increased Indian activities in the spheres of maritime security, cooperation, and navigation security, as the country transitions from a passive maritime actor to an exceptionally active one, with an equally important say in the Indo-Pacific, one of the most coveted and disputed regions in the world.</p>



<h4><strong>Bi-annual Exchange of Prisoner List Between India and Pakistan</strong></h4>



<p>As India has constantly tried to increase its presence on the international stage, it has found itself at an impasse with its neighbours on a multitude of issues. However, amidst this highly taut and tense environment, India and Pakistan recently exchanged a <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32804/Exchange_of_list_of_prisoners_between_India_and_Pakistan">list of prisoners</a> on the 1st of July. The exchange of lists is in accordance with the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-prisoners-based-on-2008-agreement/articleshow/67334191.cms?from=mdr">2008 agreement</a>, where the nations exchange a list of prisoners bi-annually, which is on the 1st of January and the 1st of July. The Indian lists contain 265 Pakistani civilians and 97 fishermen. On the other hand, the list issued by Pakistan contains 54 Indian civilians and 270 fishermen. Furthermore, to expedite the process, the Indian government has provided the nationality verification details of 7 civilians and 106 fishermen. Lastly, to show India’s commitment to the bilateral process, the central government has asked the Pakistan authorities to confirm the nationality status of 88 Pakistani prisoners in Indian custody.</p>



<h4><strong>India-China Dialogue Between Special Representatives</strong></h4>



<p>As mentioned earlier, India finds itself in an extremely precarious position when it comes to both its neighbours. However, the statement is especially true regarding its relationship with China over the Actual Line of Control. The escalation in violence in the Galwan Valley and the loss of life of Indian and Chinese soldiers was the first since 1975. This extremely volatile situation has both the governments scratching their heads as to what needs to be done next to diffuse the simmering atmosphere. China has chosen to strike a blow against India when it is busy dealing with the surge in casualties as a result of the COVID pandemic. However, in the last few months, India has chosen to follow a hardline stance against the Chinese. This has visibly resulted in increased violence on the border regions and has led to a campaign within the Indian polity advocating the ban of all Chinese products and applications. </p>



<p>However, recently there was a dialogue between the special representatives of the two countries. During the conversation, Ajit Doval, India’s National Security Advisor and H.E Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs for China, had an in-depth exchange of views on the border issue. During the discussion, several important points were highlighted, the first among them being that peace and tranquillity were essential for the further development of bilateral relations. Hence, it was agreed upon to disengage and pull back all troops from the Line of Actual Control and complete de-escalation on the India-China border. Secondly, both sides agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control and vowed to not take any unilateral action in the region.</p>



<h4><strong>India-Russia Bilateral Relations</strong></h4>



<p>In a further effort to strengthen bilateral relations, the Indian Prime Minister had a telephonic conversation with the President of the Russian Federation, wherein they discussed several strategic topics of interest to both nations. Mr Modi also used this opportunity to congratulate the President on the successful completion of the parade, marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. More importantly, Mr Modi felicitated President Putin on the recent constitutional vote, through which President Putin has consolidated his power till 2036. The Prime minster further recalled the participation of an <a href="https://theprint.in/defence/contingent-of-army-navy-air-force-to-participate-in-russias-victory-day-parade-on-24-june/445039/">Indian contingent</a> in the parade in Moscow, as a sign of friendship. Lastly, the Indian Government expressed their enthusiasm for hosting President Putin, later in the year during the bilateral summit.</p>



<h4><strong>India’s Participation at the ‘Strengthening Consensus for Peace’ in Afghanistan</strong></h4>



<p>Afghanistan over the last many decades has been turned into a complete war zone, with the presence of uninvited international actors. However, in the last two years, there have been constructive steps taken by both the Afghan government and the United States of America to bring the Taliban to the negotiation table in an effort to end the violence and bring lasting peace to the region. Lately, the Islamic Republic hosted a regional meeting, by the name of, ‘ <a href="https://mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32599/Telephonic_conversation_between_Prime_Minister_and_Vladimir_V_Putin_President_of_Russia_on_COVID19">Strengthening Consensus for Peace</a>’. The meeting was chaired by the Afghan President, H.E Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ghani. The conference recorded participation by 20 countries and international organizations. During the conference, India expressed support for establishing a constitutional order in Afghanistan and unequivocally stated the importance of putting an end to terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens for destructive forces in Afghanistan.</p>



<h4><strong>Indian Nomination to the United Nations Security Council</strong></h4>



<p>Lastly, India recently secured its position as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, with a vote of 184 out of 192. However, to fill in the seat of the Ambassador/Permanent Representative to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva, Shri Mani Pandey, who currently serves as the Additional Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs has been appointed.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Looking at India’s foreign policy from a macro perspective, we come to see that India has consistently tried to create an environment of inclusiveness then whether it be in the Indo-Pacific or the Western sectors of the Indian Ocean Region. India’s willingness to corporate and emerge as a regional power is a visible thought of its efforts in Afghanistan and its strategic partnerships with countries like the Russian Federation and France. In the last two decades, China has developed by leaps and bounds and has emerged not as a regional power but as a global hegemon. This has overshadowed nations like India, owing to China’s aggressive policies. Hence, while India tries to extend its reach globally, it has locked horns with China recently in the Galwan Valley region. The Indian and the Chinese sides seem to be ideologically clashing with each other over the Indo-Pacific, one of the most disputed regions of the world. It is India’s capabilities to fight off both the COVID 19 and the Chinese aggression, that will define the India that emerges in the near future.</p>
