										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">In the twenty-first century, as the world grapples with a deadly pandemic, another sub-pandemic seems to be taking roots in most societies – that of domestic violence against women. Termed by United Nations Women as the ‘<a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic">shadow pandemic</a>’, this notion aims to highlight that as 90 countries move into lockdown mode, more than four billion people on the planet are staying home; and as a result, instances of violence against women and girls has spiked up drastically.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Confinement in homes, and lack of steady incomes, seems to have been fostering tensions and frustration in households and strain due to concerns over health and security. The lockdown is also putting women in isolation with violent partners, with nowhere to turn to for help. In India, the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncw-records-sharp-spike-in-domestic-violence-amid-lockdown/article31835105.ece">National Commission for Women</a> has reported a 200 per cent increase in the reporting and stress call numbers of domestic violence on their helpline in the month of June alone.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Even before the lockdown was imposed, domestic violence was one of the most prevalent violations of human rights and a key impediment to the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with one in three women have experienced it at some point in their lives. Economist&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#how-many-women-are-missing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amartya Sen</a>&nbsp;has estimated in 1990 that more than 100 million women are ‘missing’ — that includes those that never lived because of sex-selective abortions and infanticide, child neglect and maltreatment. That number was revised in 2015 to 136 million – this just shows how females have been subject to violence, at times even before they are born, at an alarmingly high rate.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Furthermore, it is essential to address that violence against women not only affects individuals, but also households, families and communities. However, the only way to change this stark reality is to hold the aggressors accountable and ensure that the problematic social norms that perpetuate the instances of violence are also tackled in an inclusive manner. The SDGs act as an apt framework to work off of, in order to shape a violence-free world – here’s how:</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 1: No Poverty</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Women’s work – in agriculture, in communities, and at home, fuels economies and yet, isn’t regarded as ‘economic activity’. The exposure of females to incessant discrimination and mistreatment at the workplace makes them vulnerable and susceptible to gender-based violence. Women and girls are four per cent more likely to live in poverty and poor living conditions, a risk that rises up to <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2019/09/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2019">twenty-five </a>per<a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2019/09/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2019"> cent</a> as we factor-in other inequalities. Financial independence for women creates new opportunities and avenues for them to reject typical gender norms and leverage independence against violent partners. It also helps them to create a mentality of freedom and a sense of self for themselves. As a result, the reduction in poverty proves to be a catalyst towards enabling women in societies.</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 4: Quality Education</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">An <a href="https://medium.com/@UNDP/no-development-without-safety-for-all-aefe2d74a653">estimated</a> 246 million girls and boys experience school-related violence every year and one in four girls say that they never feel comfortable using school washrooms, according to a survey on youth conducted across four regions by the United Nations. Quality education is essential to ending violence against women. Educated girls are more likely to make their decisions towards family planning and managing finances, it is fundamental for the development of aspirations and skills, and children of educated women are more likely to have been safeguarded against malnutrition and illiteracy. Educational exposure also enables women to get access to leadership and decision-making opportunities. Hence, it propels them into a cycle of development that helps them create barriers to economic violence at home or in their communities.</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 5: Gender Equality</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to a 2018 <a href="https://medium.com/@UNDP/no-development-without-safety-for-all-aefe2d74a653">report</a> by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in India, 18 per cent of women and girls aged between 15 and 49 years of age have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or family member in the past twelve months. Further, someone is known to them – <em>every day</em> kills more than 137 women around the world. These figures represent a fraction of the discrimination against women in terms of opportunities, wealth, inheritance, safe access to public spaces, lack of decent work, and safe and healthy environments of living, learning, working, and engaging with their communities. These inequalities leave them extremely vulnerable to gender-based violence.</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Unsafe and poor working environments affect women regardless of their age, location, income, careers, or social standing. As of 2020, 18 countries have laws that enable husbands in preventing their wives from going to work. UN Women&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a>&nbsp;that the economic costs of violence and harassment amount to US$12 trillion every year. As of 2018, 59 countries do not have laws protecting women from sexual harassment in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wbl.worldbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workplace</a>. Economic growth cannot be achieved without the inclusion of women and their contribution to sustainable development in an empowering work environment.</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In developing countries, concerns of safety and restricted access to public transport reduce the probability of women participating in the labour market by 16.5 per cent. As the processes of urbanization and industrialization catch up to tier two and tier three cities, the UN estimates that more than 5 billion people will reside in cities by 2030. This becomes an essential notion to address in the light of crimes against women that are prevalent in most urban regions. Further, there is widespread human rights abuse in many industries, such as fast fashion, many of which employ women in majorities. Women may be subject to exploitation in such circumstances and need to be safeguarded against such instances.</p>



<h3><strong>SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In 37 countries, rape perpetrators are exempt from legal prosecution if they are married to, or subsequently marry the victim. Improving access to justice for survivors, and strengthening the legal framework against violators is an essential step towards making justice accessible for women – be it against violence, sexual misconduct at the workplace, or any crime against them. It is further imperative for women to mobilize and advocate support for their personal rights and those of their communities. This can be done digitally, individually, or at any level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">At this point in time, COVID-19 is already testing humanity in unprecedented capacities. The shadow pandemic that we have had to face additionally is a mirror to the kind of societies we have built for ourselves so far. As we emerge from the pandemic, we must renew the outlooks towards inequalities and factor them into our responses to create a more equitable and sustainably sound world.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">In the 41<sup>st</sup> session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), <a href="https://ap.ohchr.org/Documents/E/HRC/c_gov/A_HRC_41_G_11.DOCX">22 countries</a> (mostly western)  condemned China&#8217;s mass detention of the Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minority groups. Unpredictably, just a few days later, <a href="https://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=32880">37 countries</a> (mostly from Asia and Africa) responded with a&nbsp;letter&nbsp;to the United Nations praising China&#8217;s efforts towards restoring human rights. According to the&nbsp;document, no terrorist attacks have taken place in the previously problematic region for the last three years due to China&#8217;s effective measures for counter-terrorism. Fast forward to the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/which-countries-support-the-new-hong-kong-national-security-law/">44<sup>th</sup> session</a> of the UNHRC, 53 countries backed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/hong-kongs-new-security-law-the-end-of-hong-kong/">Beijing&#8217;s new national security law for Hong Kong</a>. Just 27 criticized the law, which imposes harsh penalties for imprecisely defined crimes and is widely viewed as the final blow for Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy.</p>



<h3><strong>Modern Genocide</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since the summer of 2017, we have been hearing frequently from the world media and human rights organisations, appalling reports of ginormous<strong> internment of people</strong>. Most of them who have been arbitrarily detained are Uyghur (a primarily Turkic-speaking Muslim minority ethnic group), Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). According to the latest Chinese <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011101904/http:/www.xjtj.gov.cn/sjcx/tjnj_3415/2016xjtjnj/rkjy/201707/t20170714_539450.html">census</a>, the population of Uyghurs is about&nbsp;12&nbsp;million. However, sources indicate that their population is undercounted by the Chinese authorities.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since 2017, eight hundred thousand to two million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities have vanished into an extensive network of <strong>“re-education camps”</strong>. Forcing the detainees to repudiate Islam and espouse the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seems to be the ultimate goal for the government. Former detainees reported <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/world_report_download/hrw_world_report_2019.pdf">mandatory classes</a> where they were required to recite Communist slogans and praise the CCP. Some reported the rampant presence of cameras and microphones without any blind spots monitoring their every move. Women have shared&nbsp;stories of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/abortions-iuds-and-sexual-humiliation-muslim-women-who-fled-china-for-kazakhstan-recount-ordeals/2019/10/04/551c2658-cfd2-11e9-a620-0a91656d7db6_story.html">sexual abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53220713">forced abortions</a> and having contraceptive devices implanted against their will.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Initially, China denied the existence of such camps. But once <a href="https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3a5af29dc357b4ce1fa30b8f35b0cbead1637e8d-1582219933-0-ARZeR3RcUIJ4BbhuKPH9HwVeQ_xEGD8UuYIwKl8d4kX7mZZo74aW3akiGbgRCmjnmze445Qb_vRZulsD4B1O8l2DGJEtJTneEOijFgA4dkJ9P2H9XXrUZobDFf01eiAXEHQGb8zJavwVgTdqFz7o_xPQJiv9e1PkTtDB59Biafv7wbHaF6DONQxnkYVp32e5lRoY1776spYhiW1bZvFMLT8blKaaLMMD4vRz8KPfYF7ADyy2Nji9e0kyvjTv096o21HBRDTAoAxMEuZiW6mPQEHeUgtmLl37ObXI_31IuVzI">evidence</a> started to mount with pictures, videos and testimonies, they changed their narrative and asserted that these internment camps were <strong>“vocational education centers”</strong> designed to help young, unemployed people in Xinjiang to learn job skills and the Chinese language, concealing the fact that the middle-aged population is almost wiped out in southern Xinjiang. Till date, China doesn’t accept that any human rights violation is taking place. It holds that the <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/16/c_137535821.htm?mc_cid=ace3de327f&amp;mc_eid=c8292ef9bf">purpose</a> of the camps is to get rid of the environment that breeds <strong>terrorism and religious extremism.</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Outside of the camps, Uyghurs have continued to suffer from a long clampdown by Chinese authorities. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/china0519_web.pdf">Surveillance</a> is intrusive and ubiquitous making it one of the most heavily surveilled police state in the world. Muslims are being forced to accept Communist Party officials in their homes, effectively extending state surveillance everywhere. <a href="http://www.bt.chinanews.com/bingtuan/20171211/8699.shtml">1.1 million local government officials</a> have been stationed to spend about a week every two months living in the home of a Uyghur host family. It is referred to as the <strong>“Pair Up and Become Family”</strong> campaign. Additionally, each square has a police station that closely monitors the locals through regularly scanning their ID cards and searching their mobile phones.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Fleeing out of China is not enough to escape the rule of CCP. In 2017, Uyghurs worldwide reported being contacted by Chinese police and were ordered to return home. Those who obeyed often disappeared and those who did not, received calls from family members begging them to repatriate for the fear of detention. It also coerced many countries into returning Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups to China. In 2015, Thailand returned<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/thailand-returns-uighurs-china-150709080144676.html"> nearly 100 Uyghurs</a>. In July 2017, Egyptian authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/egypt-muslims-uighurs-deportations-xinjiang-china.html">deported two dozen Uyghurs</a>, who instantaneously disappeared on arrival in China. In some cases, like Malaysia, foreign governments resisted Chinese pressure, often through the support of the United States and refused to return Uyghur individuals.</p>



<h3><strong>The Organ Scandal</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that it had performed the <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1181228.shtml">first double transplant</a> on a 59-year-old after her lungs failed due to coronavirus. The fact that the patient had to wait for <strong>merely five days for a donor to provide a perfectly matching set of lungs</strong> while the world’s waiting time for a single lung could be months and even years, raises doubts about the legitimacy of the organ harvesting program. These suspicions are being raised because China has a voluntary donor rate of only 0.6 per one million citizens. Of the 1.5 million Chinese citizens who are in need of an organ transplant donor each year, only 10,000 receive a successful match, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820883/">Journal of Biomedical Research</a>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <a href="https://chinatribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ChinaTribunal_-SummaryJudgment_17June2019.pdf">Final Judgement</a> of Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China given on 1<sup>st </sup>March 2020 declares, “Forced organ harvesting has happened in multiple places in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and on <strong>multiple occasions for a period of at least 20 years and continues to this day</strong>,”. The judgment further states that, “Falun Gong practitioners in detention were systematically subjected to blood tests and organ examinations. Dr Trey, an (expert) witness raises the question ‘Why would detained Falun Gong practitioners receive specific physical examinations (including X-Ray, ultrasound and blood tests) while at the same time being subjected to brainwashing, labour work, torture or torture death?’ He postulates that the only rational explanation is to build up a systematic medical databank of potential living organ donors.” On the basis of all the evidence on the subject, the Tribunal concluded that the medical testing of Falun Gongs and Uyghurs was related in some way to the group concerned because other prisoners were not tested. No explanation has been given by the PRC for these testings yet.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Both the Red Cross Society of China and Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting also cast doubts in this regard as there had been a <a href="https://dafoh.org/wp-content/uploads/Registered-organ-donors-in-China-2015-2016.jpg">sudden increase</a> of more than 25,000 organ donors on a single day in December 2015 and&nbsp;88,300 registered organ donors&nbsp;within a six-day period in December 2016, a number that can only be explained by a large-scale, <strong>forced</strong> organ harvesting programme. Ethan Gutmann, a human rights investigator, testified to the <a href="https://chinatribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ChinaTribunal_-SummaryJudgment_17June2019.pdf">China Tribunal</a> that “over the last 18 months, literally every Uyghur man, woman, and child – about 15 million people – have been blood and DNA tested, and that blood testing is compatible with tissue matching”.</p>



<h3><strong>The Proponents and Opponents</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China&#8217;s critics&nbsp;are mainly in the western world and also include major democracies like Australia and Japan. All 27 are considered either full or flawed democracies according to the <a href="https://www.in.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Democracy-Index-2019.pdf">Democratic Index 2019</a> given by The Economist Intelligence Unit. China is backed by a conglomeration of authoritarian and hybrid countries, including many of the world&#8217;s most brutal dictatorships namely North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Unexpectedly, most of the signatories of the letter defending China&#8217;s new policy happened to be Muslim-majority nations like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, UAE and Syria. In the past, as the members of the Organization of Islamic Co-operation (OIC), they were not muted when Myanmar persecuted Rohingya Muslims and expelled 700,000 of them to Bangladesh. They were unequivocally releasing <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/oic-statement-on-us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israels-capital/">statements </a>in condemnation when the Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But they are almost hushed on China’s attempt to suppress Islam in Xinjiang.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Albeit, some other OIC members such as Afghanistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, and Turkey refrained from signing the statement in support of Beijing. Regardless, all Muslim majority countries have ignored the call by the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/10/un-unprecedented-joint-call-china-end-xinjiang-abuses">UNHRC </a>to examine the situation in Xinjiang. There are quite a few factors which may have led these countries to keep distance from criticizing China.</p>



<p>Some OIC members are part of the <strong>Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</strong> and thus have their economic future linked up with China. The political cost of impeding the Uyghur issue would be too high for any of these countries to endure. The success of the BRI depends on the Xinjiang region as it is the main route to the Arabian Sea via Pakistan. Any instability here can jeopardize Beijing&#8217;s plans for trade connectivity, risk its investments and disturb all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Beijing remains the Arab world&#8217;s long-term consumer base for the next few decades as fluctuating oil prices and the rise of western demand for alternate energy sources endanger its economic stability.</p>



<p>China is also expending loans and grants to these nations. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-arabstates/chinas-xi-pledges-20-billion-in-loans-to-revive-middle-east-idUSKBN1K0072">$20 billion</a> in loans to Arab countries, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/pakistan-owes-china-money-owes-imf-191003104027694.html#:~:text=Pakistan%20has%20been%20borrowing%20from%20Beijing%20to%20tide%20over%20a%20financial%20crisis.&amp;text=The%20South%20Asian%20nation%20owes,out%20Pakistan%20from%20a%20crisis.">$6.7 billion</a> to Pakistan, <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/english/business/kazakh-chinese-industrial-projects-exceed-27-billion/50000265-3523943">$27 billion</a> in projects in Kazakhstan and many other central Asian nations. China&#8217;s massive investments are bearing fruit. Beijing has effectively taken advantage of the UNHRC to endorse the very activities it was created to oppose.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China is not only inflicting a cultural genocide of Uyghurs, but it is also repressing other cultural and religious minorities like Christians and Hui Muslims. It continues to abuse lawyers, human rights defenders, and activists. Any activity carried out in China to advocate for social change runs the risk of harassment by Chinese authorities. Basically, anything that the government considers as a threat to itself is a crime in its perspective. The worst violation of human rights is happening right in front of us. China is actively shifting the world narrative in its favour. Regardless of power, there are consequences for challenging China. Australia found itself in a trade dispute with its largest trading partner after pushing for international scrutiny into the origins of the novel-coronavirus. Two Canadian citizens are still being held in China after Canada arrested Huawei&#8217;s CFO on behalf of the United States. Nevertheless, China has been backlashed by the global community which grows its support for defending the human rights.</p>
