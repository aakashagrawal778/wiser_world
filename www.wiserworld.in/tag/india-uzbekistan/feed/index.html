<p><strong>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy</strong>&nbsp;— As citizens globally find themselves slightly relieved with the easing of restrictions in several countries and finally a little ray of hope shining brightly over the socio-economic horizon as the national governments start finally projecting a clarity of action in regards to combating the pandemic, we find our selves dealing with the same vexed situations, like those in the pre-pandemic days. Then whether it be the never-ending instability in the Middle-East, with the Syrian refugees facing disastrous and inhuman circumstances in their host countries and the re-emergence of political upheaval in countries like Mali, which is currently undergoing a coup. With so much happening over and above the pandemic, India, which is the last year and a half has projected itself as a regional power, acting as a bulwark against the rising aggression by the Chinese Republic, is trying it utmost to increase its engagement outside of its traditional realms of geopolitical influence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Some major updates to cover in today’s Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:</h2>



<h4><strong>17th India-Vietnam Joint Commission Meeting</strong></h4>



<p>India recently took a momentous step, by strengthening its bilateral relations with the Republic of Vietnam through the 17th India-Vietnam Joint Commission Meeting, centred around trade, economic, scientific, and technological cooperation. The meeting was co-chaired by DR. S. Jaishakar, External Affairs Minister for the Indian Republic, and H.E. Mr Pham Binh Minh, who currently serves as both the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The meeting had two major outcomes. Within the realms of Economic and Social developments, the two representatives discussed the recent progress in the India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was further aided by a discussion about the regional and international spheres of interest for the two countries. The External Affairs Ministry placed special emphasis on Prime Minister Modi’s vision of an Atmanirbhar Bharat, which focuses on self-reliance and human-centric globalization. The ministry also reasserted India’s willingness to assist Vietnam, through initiatives such as the Quick impact Projects, ITEC, PhD fellowships, and projects in water resource management. The second aspect that the two counties focused on was, strengthening their defence engagements, in line with India’s recent policy ion increasing military presence in the region. To further reinforce India’s presence at the United Nations Security Council, both countries agreed to work and collaborate closely. Lastly, the two countries decided to structure their cooperation and bilateral engagements, in line with India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and ASEAN’s outlook on the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>India-Uzbekistan Joint Projects</strong></h4>



<p>The first meeting of the National Coordination Committee of India-Uzbekistan Joint Projects was held on the 24th of the August, under the chairmanship of Mr Sardor Umurzakov, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Investments and Foreign Trade, who was assisted by the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri V. Muraleedharan. The bilateral meet was organized with the aim to review the joint projects between the two countries, which were essentially implemented under the direction of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Uzbek President Mr Shavkat Mirziyoyev. The representatives extensively reviewed the current agreements and planned out future activities in terms of economic and trade cooperation. During the meeting, special attention was paid to the status of negotiations for concluding a Bilateral Investment Treaty, and granting mutual market access for agricultural products from both countries. There was a general sense of satisfaction and hope conveyed by the two chairs, on the current status of the projects, and the strength the completion of the same would add to the bilateral relations between the two countries. Minister of State Shri V. Muraleedharan extended an invitation to Deputy Prime Minister Mr Umurzakov to visit India as per mutual convenience.</p>



<h4><strong>Statement on Foreign Secretary’s visit to Dhaka</strong></h4>



<p>The Indian Foreign Secretary, Shri Harsh Wandhan Shringla visited Bangladesh last month. The trip carried with it significant diplomatic importance. The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s visit started off with discussions regrinding the upcoming celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Bangladeshi independence and the establishment of ties between the two neighbours. The Indian delegation also chose to use the trip to highlight the assistance provided by New Delhi to Dhaka, in combating the COVID-19 and how India organized capacity-building courses for the Bangladeshi Medical Personnel, following the conference of SAARC leaders and the meeting up of the SAARC Emergency Response Fund for COVID 19. India also used the platform to announce its intentions to launch an air bubble, to resume travel between the two nations, and propose to convene a meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission at the level of Foreign Ministers, to review all the joint projects being undertaken. Lastly, the meeting recorded discussions for the safe repatriation of displaced persons from troubled regions of the Rakhine state and looked into further strengthening defence cooperation, to bring an effective stop to cross border crime. The visit of the Foreign secretary turned out to be highly beneficial for the two countries, especially for India, given its ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Diplomatic Appointments</strong></h4>



<p>Shri Shambhu S. Kumaran, who currently serves as the Ambassador of the Indian Republic to the Republic of Philippines has been appointed as the country’s Ambassador to both the Republic of Palau and The federal States of Micronesia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Seeing the increasing Indian footprint on the international political and socio-economic map,&nbsp; one can only say that the country will have a dominant role to play in shaping the world order post the pandemic. In particular, India has focused mainly on its neighbourhood, as highlighted through its ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’ and the ‘Act East Policy’. During this time of uncertainty, it is India’s ability to achieve rapid and sustainable development that will ensure the country a place at the table along with the big boys. India&#8217;s Indo-Pacific vision epitomizes its desire of being a &#8220;main force&#8221;. All things being equal, it is simply the start of a decadal venture, which will see India shoulder the desires that befit the world&#8217;s biggest popularity based economy. To do this, Delhi should continually reconsider the elements of progress in progress, picture the potential outcomes that are on offer, envision the chaperon dangers and creator the new request emerging out of Asia.</p>
