										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Post-Independence Period (till 1975) and Population Control</strong>—India was among the first nations of the world to adopt policies to control the growth of its enormous population in the post-independence period. India saw the rapid population growth as an obstacle to its economic growth hence chose to adopt a population policy as a part of its first five-year plan of 1951 which emphasised the family as a whole and stressed the use of natural devices for family planning. In the following five-year plans, population control policies common to both men and women were adopted which included working in the direction of education, adoption of a clinical approach, sterilization technique for both men and women, and encouraging all kinds of birth control measures (both conventional and modern).</p>



<h2><strong>Target-Oriented Population Control during the Emergency Period (1975-1977)</strong></h2>



<p>A major breakthrough in the population control process took place when then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced a nationwide emergency in 1975 and rigorously enforced mass sterilization programmes to bring down the population growth rate. About 6.2 million Indian men were sterilised in just a year which, according to a 2014 BBC news report, was 15 times the number of people sterilized by the Nazis. Vasectomy was a safer procedure than tubectomy, especially at that time, as it required less recovery time and follow-up hence poor men became the main targets of this gruesome campaign. The campaign to sterilise men involved many levels of harassment. There were even reports of police dragging the men to mass vasectomy camps. Men were considered easier targets for threats like job loss or fines, since they were more likely to be employed outside the home, to take public transportation and to go out or pick up government food rations.</p>



<p>Incentives and disincentives were given on a large scale for acts such as getting oneself sterilized or convincing other citizens to get sterilized. From offering plots of land in return for sterilization to threatening the loss of a government job for those who refused the procedure. While both men and women could be sterilized, the medical system was equipped to do many more vasectomies than tubectomies. Records have shown that the sterilization process mostly targeted the poor citizens and that wealthier Indians were able to buy their way out of the system. The coercive measures and the sterilizations caused a great deal of anger among the people. This unrest caused in the country is also considered as one of the reasons why Indira Gandhi’s government was voted out in the 1977 elections.</p>



<h2><strong>Voluntary Period since 1997</strong></h2>



<p>The next major breakthrough happened after the emergency period where the Indian government took a 180° turn and began to turn its family planning policy towards women. Female sterilizations became by far the most popular method of contraception. Family planning programmes further extended to rural areas through the network of primary health centres. The most fundamental change of the Indian population policy since 1977 was that family planning became mostly voluntary. The Indian government now put more emphasis on incentives to attract people to accept family planning voluntarily instead of forceful measures. During the Seventh Five Year Plan period between 1986 and 1991, the Indian government’s population control policy extended to including both long term and short term as well as specific goals. The long-term goal was to fix the net reproduction rate to be achieved by 2001 and the short-term goal focused on the female minimum age of marriage and the practice of contraception. The specific goal was to promote a two-child norm by increasing awareness among the people about family planning and responsible parenthood. The government efforts in population control now also extended to increase the literacy rate of the population and especially women.</p>



<h2><strong>Formation of the ICPD (1994)</strong></h2>



<p>The year 1994 is considered to be a noteworthy one in the history of family planning programmes in the world since the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) convened under the United Nations at Cairo in 1994 made some recommendations that were accepted by many developing countries including India that changed the direction of family planning programmes. The conference recommended that family planning programmes should not be driven by demographic goals but instead, they should be based on women’s reproductive rights and reproductive health, keeping in mind the well-being of everyone (International Institute for Population Sciences, 2016).</p>



<h2><strong>Adoption of NPP in the year 2000</strong></h2>



<p>India adopted the National Population Policy (NPP) in the year 2000 which decentralized the decision making to local government and improved the coordination between the government and the local and non-government organizations. Stress was given to improve the status of mothers and children. The programme focuses on the improvement of health care infrastructure and services and the empowerment of women. It also gives more emphasis to use of contraceptive methods like IUCDs, promotes delayed marriage for girls, provides a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory education up to 14 years of age, seeks to achieve universal immunization of children against all vaccine preventable diseases and to reduce infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births. Insurance is provided for the deaths, complications and failures caused by sterilization; compensating those who accept sterilizations and increasing male participation in family planning. Family welfare is now promoted as a people-centered program.</p>



<h2><strong>Endnote</strong></h2>



<p>Overpopulation is the root cause of numerous problems like low per capita income, unemployment and overburdened natural resources among many others. Therefore, the need of the hour today is a more effective measure to reduce the population growth in Indian society. Importance has to be given to population education, achievement of equal status for women and lower caste people, development of economy, urbanization, and modernization of the whole society. When socioeconomic conditions improve, the birth rate will be lower and the overpopulation problem will be reduced (Population Control Policies and Implementations in India, 2019).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>The last six decades of India-China relationships have been replete with instances of suspicion, hostility as well as antagonism which used to be earlier marked with bonds of mutual mistrust, friendliness and cordial atmosphere. The challenge has always been to bridge the differences of opinion from both sides and devise a common consensus that both of these growing powers of the world can adhere to and agree to.</em></p>



<p><em>One shouldn’t presume that Beijing and New Delhi have always been on the opposite poles of the spectrum as serious attempts have always been made to facilitate discussion and promote diplomacy in its truest essence. From the </em><strong><em>Panchseel Agreement of 1945 </em></strong><em>to the recent </em><strong><em>Galway valley violence of 2020 </em></strong><em>&#8211; do these countries still believe in dialogue for peace’ as the belief that the Ministry of External Affairs holds or has– <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hindi-Chinni Bhai-Bhai</strong></span> period already becoming into <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hindi-Chinni bye-bye</strong></span> period.</em></p>



<p><em>While promising a stable bilateral relationship it is imperative to note how cross-cutting sensitive issues of the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/ladakh-intrusion-swerving-from-an-uncaring-towards-a-dancing-dragon-yet-treacherous/">border dispute</a>, country contours, diverging projections of geopolitical interest, security ties with other powers, close affiliations with Pakistan and the United States forces us to look at multiple vantage points in this already complicated affair &#8211; thus raising the burning questions whether as INDIA and China both take over the world stage are they willing to ‘confront’ and ‘concile’?</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“Today, being the biggest developing countries in the world, China and India are both committed to developing their economy and raising their people&#8217;s living standards’’ </em></strong></p><cite>&#8211; <strong><em>Li Peng</em></strong></cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>



<p>The past 60 years of India- China relations have signalled that both countries have been making a concerted effort to embark on seeking mutually acceptable resolutions to the main contention relating to a boundary issue. The major provocations which confront this asymmetrical correspondence been to build <strong>mutual trust </strong>and <strong>confidence. </strong>The trust deficit which plagues both sides has decimated the robustness of bilateral relationships where the element of trust is an essential pillar in maintaining a sustained balance. Somehow, the lack of these essential components of confidence-building feigns grounds of hostility towards one &#8211; another and gives rise to biases dwelling on power dynamics.</p>



<p>The deepening of relations can be traced to the signing of <span class="highlight"><strong>the Strategic and Cooperative Partnership for Peace and Prosperity in 2005 </strong>and <strong>A Shared Vision for 21st Century in 2008</strong></span><strong> </strong>which serves as a reminder of our neighbourhood while laying foundations for a future that envisions us growing together; however it&#8217;s saddening to see how we are walking on eggshells now as our cordial relations reach a breakthrough.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, India and China have emerged as the two rapidly growing economies and their bilateral relationship to a greater extent has assumed global and strategic relevance. The objective of this article will be to assess and analyze the broad overview of India-China relations, throwing light on issues that fragment them while we chart our future prospects of convergence. It is of utmost importance to questions what lies the way forward for both the ‘dragon’ and the ‘peacock’ as uncertain times dawn and reciprocal development is the need of the hour.</p>



<h2><strong>EVOLUTION OF RELATIONSHIP</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a glimpse of the past 70 years gone by, China-India relations have moved ahead despite wind and rain and have followed their own course of growth despite all odds. Since the 1950s, the leaders laid the stone to establish diplomatic relations between China and India, as they Cooperatively championed the ‘<strong>Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.’</strong></p>



<p>As consensus was maintained in the era of initial cordiality the <strong><em>Panchsheel Agreement </em></strong>was signed which ascribed the <em>‘guiding principles’ </em>of India-China bilateral relationship as its ideals of <em>‘non-interference in each other&#8217;s internal affairs while respect for territorial unity, integrity and sovereignty</em>’ coursed through both nations.</p>



<p>However, it was Zhou Enlai’s trip to India in June 1954 which was a mark of China’s intent to uphold it promises while also reinstating another historic event where a communist head of government was making a peacetime visit to a non-communist state.</p>



<p>The animosity and hostilities gained momentum during the decade of 1959 &#8211; 1976, where this rough patch resulted in the infamous war of 1962. During this period, there was a sharp shift in the perception of China where negative connotations of it being seen as an aggressive neighbour that sought to humiliate a democratic India garnered headlines. A dramatic transference of ideologies as well as values of peaceful and friendly consultation, </p>



<p>established strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity, while achieving all-round development of bilateral relations marked the much of 1980s.</p>



<p>In the post-1998 scenario after India detonated a nuclear device, China was a staunch critic of this development thus putting a roadblock in their relationship. However, the situation changed after the realisation set in about each other’s contribution to the global economy and to a greater extent started broadening the then-existing bilateral ties. The strain in the relationship was replaced by an era of cooperation in the economic sphere while disagreements on respective political fronts.</p>



<p>While tracing the genealogy of Sino &#8211; Indian relations we come across the phase commenced by the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by initiating the concept of <strong>&#8220;hometown diplomacy” </strong>which ranged from informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai to strategic communication on long-term issues of global and regional importance while agreeing to facilitate development and close partnership</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s achievements of China-India relations embody the concise and regular efforts of several generations from whom we need to draw inspiration from the past as experiences of the present tragically make us critical of each other&#8217;s intentions.</p>



<p>As we stand on the brink of a new starting point present-day decision-makers should draw wisdom from our thousands of years of civilisations and explore authentic ways to stay true to the essence of ‘ brotherhood’ envisioned years ago as we look forward towards; &#8220;enhancing mutual trust, focusing on cooperation, managing differences and seeking common development&#8221;.</p>



<h2><strong>CHALLENGES TO THE I</strong>NDIA-CHINA<strong> PARTNERSHIP</strong></h2>



<p>Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi often resonate with the philosophy, where the whole world is seen as a family of the whole rather than functioning in splinters, which runs parallel with the Chinese philosophical concept of &#8220;universal peace&#8221; and &#8220;universal love” thus reiterating the belief that the &#8220;Dragon-Elephant Tango” does hold the potential to create a new chapter in building a community with a shared future if they agree to make credible and foresighted peaceful endeavours towards the issues of contention like :</p>



<ul><li>To devise an early settlement of the border problem and to prevent the enduring stalemate from completely undermining the confidence that remains between the two nations</li><li>To reconcile regional strategies in South Asia, Central Asia, ASEAN, and the Indian Ocean;</li><li>To promote confidence-building measures and eliminate misperceptions while avoiding the misreading of each other’s strategic intentions, </li><li> To envisage each other’s core interests and strategic sensitivities</li><li>To reinforce the bolstering effect of vibrant trade, economic links and developmental ties in sustaining a stable bilateral relationship;</li><li>To breathe more substance into the existing framework of the declared Sino-Indian strategic partnership.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>THE WAY THAT LIES AHEAD</strong></h2>



<p>This journey of facilitating change and strengthening the relationship needs to be steered by mastering the four keys of <strong><em><span class="highlight">&#8220;leading, transmitting, shaping and integrating”</span> </em></strong>&#8211; the basics of enhancing trust and to instil confidence amongst one &#8211; another.</p>



<p>“Leading&#8221; pertains to reaching consensus and guide the direction of the development of bilateral relations under the guidance of leaders. &#8220;Transmitting&#8221; means to transmit the leaders’ consensus to all levels as they get translated into tangible cooperation and outcomes. &#8220;Shaping&#8221; refers to go beyond the mode of managing differences while accumulating the positive momentum of shaping bilateral relations. &#8220;Integrating&#8221; at the end concerns strengthening exchanges and cooperation while promoting convergence of interests and achieve common development.</p>



<p>There is no doubt in saying that the levels of engagement between India and China have increased certainly but India, at the same time, requires to move forward with a sophisticated approach to deal with the emerging strategic challenges being emanating from China. Power dynamics often remain at the core of weak reciprocal agreements however this holds no vitality in the context here as, despite the fact that China has become increasingly assertive not only at the regional level but also at the global level, India has not shown any displeasure so far in strongest terms.</p>



<p>In the current circumstances, it is obvious that trade has come to be viewed as an increasingly important facilitator of relations especially in the shadow of lingering political mistrust as issues ranging from the long-running protracted border dispute to China’s close affiliations with Pakistan to India’s cordial allegiance with the US defies the purpose of simplifying the conflict.</p>



<p>The signing of an Agreement on <span class="highlight"><strong><em>“Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the Border Dispute</em></strong>”</span>, by both India and China is a major stride in moving ahead in terms of reaching a consensus on this major irritant while also joining hands in a promise to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border front. But, at the same, it’s needless to highlight that this requires a careful assessment especially on the intent and declarations of outcomes.</p>



<p>China has always been a hardcore follower of following the tenets of the <strong>&#8216;Monroe<em> Doctrine’. </em></strong>The attempt has always been to deny access to other powers in the region that it perceives as exclusively within its sphere of influence. As the time has come to breathe more substance into the existing framework of strategic partnership it is essential on the part of India to remind Beijing how these stipulated actions have been damaging the interests of other regions especially to the countries in the East and South-East Asia.</p>



<p>In the long term, neither Indian nor Chinese defence strategists can rule out the possibility of a renewed confrontation over the disputed territory (Tibet, Kashmir, Myanmar, or the Indian Ocean ) as China becomes the other alternative unchallenged power and India continues to increase its circumference of influence thus signalling that a Sino-Indian rivalry in southern Asia may well be a dominant feature of future Asian geopolitics of the twenty-first century thus compelling the regional actors to choose sides. The nature of the rivalry will be facilitated by how domestic political and economic developments, as well as internal mechanisms of these two countries, affect their power, their outlooks, and their foreign and security policies on the international platform. On the flip side, it can also be noted that while they are competitors for power and influence in Asia, China and India also share interests in maintaining regional stability as well as exploiting economic opportunities while promoting regional cooperation &#8211; all of which could act as indispensable factors in influencing their relationship.</p>



<p>Last but not least, there comes a pressing necessity where one under these idealistic terms of co-operation, unity and oneness must not forget the real question where countries wonder: <strong><em><span class="highlight">‘WHETHER CO-OPERATION AND COMPARATIVE ELEMENTS IN BETWEEN POWERFUL WORLD POWERS COEXIST ?’</span></em></strong></p>

<h2>OneWeb</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb">OneWeb</a>, previously known as WorldVu Satellites Ltd is a global communications company building a capability to deliver broadband satellite internet services to a geographically global demographic. Greg Wyler founded the company in 2012. In 2020, the company entered<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb"> bankruptcy </a>after failing to raise the requisite capital to complete the build and deployment of the remaining 90% of the network. The company laid off approximately 85% of its approximately 500 employees but retained the capability to control its operational satellites during the period of court protection. The company recently came into news as it was revived under the joint ownership of the UK government and Bharti Global.</p>

According to the ExecutiveBiz, OneWeb has now raised $1.4B in total funding after it received additional investments from Hughes Network Systems and SoftBank Group. This funding will enable OneWeb to realise their plan of having a constellation consisting of 648 satellites in low Earth orbit by 2022. The main aim behind this is that it will enable broadband connectivity and low-latency communication services to people all around the globe. Despite gaining a significant amount of funding, they are still only halfway through. This is probably why the company has decided to cut back on the number of constellations. But the company insists that despite the drop in numbers, the constellation architecture will remain the same.</p>



<p>“This solidification of OneWeb&#8217;s constellation demonstrates the commitment and vision of OneWeb’s new owners, the UK Government and Bharti Global who are dedicated to deploying a cost-effective, responsible, and groundbreaking satellite network to deliver global broadband.</p>



<p>OneWeb remains focused on launching its first-generation system of 648 satellites and is on track to start regional commercial services within a year. Today’s streamlining activities highlight OneWeb’s plan for global connectivity services and for future generations and possibilities for the network.”</p>



<h3>Aim of OneWeb</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Airbus_OneWeb_900-satellites_video-879x485-1.jpg" alt="Aims of OneWeb Contellation Project" class="wp-image-4287" width="570" height="307"/><figcaption>Aims of OneWeb Contellation Project | (Source: <a href="https://www.airbus.com/space/telecommunications-satellites/oneweb-satellites-connection-for-people-all-over-the-globe.html">Airbus</a>)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The main aim of OneWeb is to “deliver broadband connectivity worldwide to bridge the global Digital Divide by offering everyone, everywhere access including to the Internet of Things (IoT) future and a pathway to 5G”. </p>



<p>By mid-2022, OneWeb plans to launch high-speed internet in India as well. Mittal, the owner, stated that “For rural broadband, I would say Africa, India and less developed countries will benefit from OneWeb’s satellite network. They will have the biggest benefit. For critical applications such as defence, the ministry of defence in the UK is already engaging with us because they need connectivity in very remote areas&#8221;. The satellite network will prove advantageous for the 5G network as it will penetrate even the areas fibre and radio waves could not reach.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Starlink</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Starlink_Mission_47926144123-min-1.jpg" alt="Starlink satellites orbiting Earth prior to deployment." class="wp-image-4300" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Starlink_Mission_47926144123-min-1.jpg 960w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Starlink_Mission_47926144123-min-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Starlink_Mission_47926144123-min-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption><em>Starlink satellites orbiting Earth prior to deployment.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Just like OneWeb, Starlink is another satellite internet constellation. It is being constructed by Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink">constellation</a> will consist of thousands of mass-produced small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), working in combination with ground transceivers. SpaceX plans to sell some of the satellites for military, scientific, or exploratory purposes. The estimated cost of this project is US$10 billion. The company has already launched 1000 satellites and people are eager to enjoy the high-speed internet.</p>



<h3>Recent Developments in Starlink</h3>



<p>Starlink has <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/elon-musk-targets-telecom-for-next-disruption-with-starlink-internet-101611313439807.html">launched </a>a number of satellites, and there are now roughly 960 functioning satellites in orbit, heralding an age of mega-constellations that have prompted worries about visual pollution for astronomers. But SpaceX claims that the compact architectural design of Starlink satellites and the company following all the regulatory and industry standards will enable them to keep the space clean.&nbsp;SpaceX has <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/spacex-passes-starlink-1000-satellite-launch-mark-2021-01/">permission</a> from regulators to launch up to 12,000 satellites and has been planning to send up 42 batches of 60 satellites in a year, to add to its commercial constellation. Right at the beginning of this year, SpaceX launched the 17th batch, consisting of 60 Starlink Satellites using a Falcon 9 rocket. They plan to launch many more to reach their goal soon. Starlink has constantly been testing their satellite internet connection. On 4 November 2020, SpaceX conducted its one-millionth Starlink test and doubled the connection speed. Starlink beta testers have been reporting speeds over 150 megabits per second, above the range announced for the public beta test.</p>



<h3>Aim of Starlink</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-4293" width="564" height="317" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM-1170x658.jpeg 1170w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-10.11.14-PM.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /><figcaption><em>Source: SpaceX</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>SpaceX intends to provide satellite internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as provide competitively priced service to urban areas. According to <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/spacex-passes-starlink-1000-satellite-launch-mark-2021-01/">ElectronicsWeekly</a>, “The goal (of SpaceX) is to build a high-speed global satellite internet service, for which Elon Musk’s company is in competition with the likes of Amazon and OneWeb. With download speeds of up to 50MBps, the aim is to support gaming-level Internet access.”&nbsp; SpaceX claims that “During the beta, users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system.”</p>



<p>Apart from the goal of high-speed internet, SpaceX also plans to develop a similar satellite communication for Mars.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With the upcoming OneWeb and Starlink satellite constellations, we surely are headed towards a new era. These projects will revolutionize the world of telecommunications. High-speed satellite internet, in even the remotest corners of the world, is a dream that will be realized soon. With consistent launches, Starlink is making huge leaps towards its goal.&nbsp;Needless to say, it has the capability to provide a tough competition to the OneWeb satellite constellation. With OneWeb scaling back its number of satellites, Starlink has an upper hand as they show no sign of slowing down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The joy of stepping into a new decade was soon quashed, as nations struggled to maintain political stability and carry on parliamentary work. The past week has been filled with geopolitical drama. Whether it be the United Kingdom officially leaving the European Union, which I am sure would have brought a smile to Charles De Gaulle, or whether it be a siege on the ‘Temple of Democracy’ itself. Of the many things one expected 2021 to behold, I am sure none expected such a dramatic start to the year. However, we as usual focus on what the Indian government is doing in the field of Foreign Policy.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Turkmenistan Foreign Office Consultations</strong></h2>



<p>Virtual <a href="http://www.businessworld.in/article/India-Turkmenistan-hold-foreign-office-consultations-discuss-economic-cooperation/13-01-2021-365212/">Foreign Consultations</a> between the Indian Republic and Turkmenistan was held on the 13th of January, 2021. The Indian delegation was led by Shri Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West), while the delegation from Turkmenistan was led by H.E Mr. Vepa Hajiyev, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.</p>



<p>The primary rationale behind the consultations was to undertake a systematic review of bilateral relations between the two countries. This included political, economic, commercial, defense, and consular cooperation. Both sides used the opportunity to exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interests and agreed to enhance cooperation in the United Nations and the multilateral arena.</p>



<h2><strong>3rd Senior Officials Meeting of Arab-India Cooperation Forum</strong></h2>



<p>On the 12th of January 2021, the third <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-arab-league-vow-to-deepen-cooperation-in-counter-terrorism/article33563866.ece">India-Arab Cooperation Forum</a> took place. The Forum meeting was co-chaired by Shri Sanjay Bhattacharyya, Secretary (CPV&amp;OIA), and Ambassador Mohamed Abu Al-Kheir, Assistant Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of Egypt to the League of Arab States with the participation of Senior Officials from the Arab States and India, as well as the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States.</p>



<p>The Representative hailed the strong foundation, great potential, and wide-ranging prospects for Arab-India cooperation. They also used the opportunity to recall the historic ties between the Arab world and India. Through the Forum, the leaders stressed the need for political solutions to regional issues and crisis in the Middle East, particularly the Palestinian issues, the crisis in Syria, Libya, and Yemen, and underscored the need for cooperation in combating terrorism and ensuring freedom of navigation and maritime security, according to the principles of international law.</p>



<p>The Arab side congratulated the Republic of India on its election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for a two-year term (2021-2022), while looking forward to India’s continuing pivotal role at the international stage, particularly concerning regional issues of mutual concern. They agreed on the early scheduling of the joint activities of the Forum, including the 3rd Session of Arab-India Cultural Festival, the Symposium on Arab-India Cooperation in the field of Energy, the 1st Arab-India University Presidents Conference, the 2nd</p>



<p>Symposium on Arab-India Cooperation in the field of Media, and the 6th Session of Arab-India Partnership Conference.</p>



<h2><strong>India and France hold Strategic Dialogue</strong></h2>



<p>Shri Ajit Doval, National Security Advisor, led the Indian delegation during the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/france-and-india-hold-strategic-dialogue/">India-France Strategic Dialogue</a>. The French delegation was led by Mr. Emmanuel Bonne, Diplomatic Advisor to the French President.</p>



<p>The Strategic dialogue between the two countries included discussions on a variety of issues including counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, defense cooperation, and the Indo-Pacific region. Both sides reaffirmed the high priority they accord to the India-France strategic partnership and highlighted the convergence of views between the two countries.</p>



<p>Following his meeting with Shri Ajit Doval, the French advisor called upon the Prime Minister, Shiri Narendra Modi, the Defence Minister, and the External Affairs Minister. He also addressed the Vivekananda International Foundation on &#8220;France and India: Partners for a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.</p>



<h2><strong>India-Germany Leaders&#8217; Video-Teleconference</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi held a video conference with his German counterpart, Federal Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel. The Prime Minister started the exchange by appreciating, Dr. Merkel’s long-standing role in providing stable and strong leadership at the European and global stage, and thanked her for strengthening the India-Germany Strategic Partnership.</p>



<p>The two leaders discussed key issues of mutual importance including the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, bilateral ties, regional and global issues, particularly India-EU relations. The Prime Minister used the opportunity to brief his German counterpart on the developments in India with regard to vaccine development and assured her of India’s commitment to using its capacity for the betterment of all countries.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister welcomed Germany’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and expressed his desire to further strengthen cooperation with Germany under the platform of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). The two heads of state agreed to hold the sixth Intergovernmental Consultations at an early date in 2021, and to create an ambitious agenda for the same, given that this year marks the 70th anniversary of setting up bilateral relations between India and Germany.</p>



<h2><strong>Exchange of list of prisoners between India and Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>Keeping with the provisions of the 2008 Agreement, The Indian Republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan exchanged lists of civilian prisoners and fishermen in their respective custody. The Indian government handed over a list of 263 Pakistani civilian prisoners and a list of 77 fishermen. The Pakistan government’s list included 49 Indian Civilians and a total of 270 fishermen, who according to the Islamic Republic are Indians or believed to be Indians.</p>



<p>Upon the exchange of lists, the Indian government asked to expedite the release and repatriation of 3 Indian civilian prisoners and 185 Indian fishermen, whose nationality has been confirmed and conveyed to Pakistan. Additionally, the Indian government has requested consular access to Indian fishermen and 22 civilians prisoners who are believed to be Indians. In keeping with the 2008 agreement, the Indian government requested access for Indian medical personnel to assess the mental conditions of the believed to be Indian prisoners.</p>



<p>At the exchange, the Indian government reaffirmed its priority towards all humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in both countries. In view of the COVID 19 pandemic, the Indian government requested the Pakistan government to ensure the safety, security, and welfare of all Indians and believed- to-be Indian civil prisoners and fishermen.</p>



<h2><strong>India Delivers Humanitarian Assistance &amp; Disaster Relief Support to Fiji after Tropical Cyclone Yasa</strong></h2>



<p>The Fiji islands were hit by a category 5 Tropical <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-humanitarian-assistance-disaster-relief-support-to-cyclone-hit-fiji/story-CjzaeQ4W4g8YCol8QOsuiP.html">Cyclone Yasa</a> in December. The Cyclone caused massive damage to the islands. In light of this natural calamity, the Indian government decided to provide humanitarian assistance through material aid. The relied material provided by the Indian government included shelter and hygiene kits, the government additionally also agreed to provide immediate assistance to the cyclone-affected communities.</p>



<p>A massive undertaking of this nature was possible owing to the work carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and were airlifted to the Fiji Islands, with the help of Air India and the Fiji Islands, through Sydney, Australia. India stood by Fiji during times of crisis and devastation, as this was not the first time that India provided the country assistance. Back in 2016, India was the leading nation to undertake humanitarian work on the islands following Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. India’s actions speak of its commitment to provide Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief support to friendly Foreign Countries as a first responder. India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific is in line with the Indo-Pacific Oceans initiative announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.</p>



<h2><strong>Telephone Conversation between Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of UK The Rt Hon Boris Johnson</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi conducted a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson appreciated the Indian government’s invitation to the Republic Day, but regretted his inability to attend, given the changed COVID 19 context in the UK.</p>



<p>The leaders reviewed ongoing cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi, congratulated Mr. Johnson and his government for achieving the</p>



<p>highest vaccination numbers in Europe. The two leaders agreed to cooperate in the near future to make the COVID 19 vaccines available for the world. Lastly, the heads of state reiterated their shared belief in the potential of the India-UK partnership in the post-Brexit, post-Covid context, and agreed to work towards a comprehensive roadmap for realizing this potential.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Keeping aside the boiling tensions in the United States, we have noted a trend in geopolitical actions, wherein states have adopted a more cooperative attitude. This is particularly true with India, as can be seen through the points that we have covered in the report. In the coming months, it would be interesting to see the nature of the relationship that the Indian government develops with the Biden- Harris administration, and this would affect its policies in the Indo-pacific and the Middle East.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Domestic Tourism-Connecting people, societies and cultures together&nbsp;</strong>— India, spanning across 29 states and 8 union territories, offers unique cultural diversity. Whether you are hiking in the mountains, sitting around the bonfire with your friends, roaming in the old streets of Varanasi, attending Ganga Aarti in Rishikesh or diving in the Havelock Island at Andaman, you will find yourself amidst the beautiful colours of India. Every part of the country has something unexplored for you; where you can set out your foot. The unparalleled diversity of the large landmass attracts millions of tourists every year. The contribution of the tourism industry to the GDP stands at 9.5 per cent (Darbari, 2020). Tourism being the labour-intensive industry has a number of other economic agents associated with it. Some of these agents include travel agents, trekking and hiking operators, hostels, hotels, taxi drivers and restaurants (Ghosh, 2020). All these agents together create the tourism ecosystem. If we go down the tourism value chain, we find that these agents be it local shopkeepers who sell the handicrafts of the local artisans or the taxi drivers who carry tourists from one tourist destination to others are the lifelines of the tourism industry. One in every eight jobs in India is directly or indirectly linked to tourism (Nath, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>COVID-19: An opportunity to fix the problems in the Tourism Industry &nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>It was in the month of March when people were busy packing their bags and planning the itineraries to go on a holiday spree that COVID-19 hit the country. This led to the disruption of the global supply chain with all the economic activities coming to a halt. With the restrictions on the movement of people across the international borders in place, domestic tourism emerged as the ‘silver lining’ for the country. Over the years, due to the propagation of the networks, Indians have increasingly become aware of the lesser-known destinations which are the hidden treasures in our geography. The domestic tourism registered a growth rate of around 10 per cent with the number of domestic tourists increasing from 1.05 billion to 1.85 billion from 2016 to 2019. This is in due line with the ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ campaign which is started by the Ministry of Tourism to boost domestic tourism (ETTravelWorld, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>COVID-19, despite its negative effects on the tourism industry, can be turned into an opportunity to fix the problems and challenges that have pre-existed in the industry. As we adapt to the new normal, there is a need to mould India’s tourism industry into the one that is sustainable in the long run. Given the varied recovery plans adopted by the states, the revival strategies will have to be tailored to the specific context (Darbari, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Reviving the Domestic Tourism&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The first step to the recovery is rebuilding consumer trust and confidence. As the tourists will be back to travelling with a changed mindset, they need the assurance that all the safety and health standards are in place during their stay which would, in turn, require percolation of the technological innovation in the tourism industry. The COVID-19 gave ample time to the hotels and the tourist places to access their carrying capacity and accordingly devise the strategies to ensure social distancing as people have started to travel again. The proper implementation of the carrying capacity across all the popular tourists&#8217; destination will ensure that people follow the social distancing norms as they spread out and contribute to the livelihood of people who are directly dependent on the tourism.&nbsp; This will serve the dual purpose of restoring the ecological imbalance caused by over-tourism while boosting domestic tourism in the emerging destinations of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Indian state has regions that are heavily dependent on tourism. These regions should be used as the basis for developing a comprehensive recovery plan for the tourism sector along with the local economy. The various stakeholders such as local government, tourism associations, transport associations, business houses, civil bodies and state government must work together to take proactive measures so that people are aware of the tourist places that exist in their own regions and the historical importance of visiting these places (Siddiqui, 2020). All these stakeholders have to complement each other’s working and focus on making the regional people as the important stakeholder of the industry. The local bodies who constitute these regional people must comply with the Tourism Department of the State and work together in devising the guidelines related to sanitization of the rooms, lodges, hotels and restaurants for <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/travel-tourism-sector-sustainable-tourism-and-why-is-it-essential/">sustaining the tourism industry</a> within the vicinity of the region. This will further boost the confidence in the tourists as they will receive better quality services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The destinations which are emerging as the tourism hotspots in India are facing challenges in terms of disposal of the waste. The waste is either burnt or left untreated in the landfills which release toxic chemicals that are harmful to the environment.&nbsp; As tourism is resuming, the destinations will see a significant increase in the number of biomedical wastes such as sanitizers, masks and gloves. This disposal will lead to contamination both among locals as well as tourists. In order to stop this contamination, the collection drives should be initiated across the tourist’s destinations of the country so that the biomedical waste is able to reach the nearest recycling centres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tourism is often believed for creating the livelihoods of rural communities through sustainable development. However, it was observed that the tourism policies of India have focused more on the creation of tourists orientated destinations that cater to their demands. For example, Ladakh, known for its natural landscapes and breathtaking views, receives very less rainfall annually and every drop of water is preciously preserved for carrying out agriculture in the area. But the growing domestic tourism which is kept unchecked is leading to the scarcity of the water as the tourists are demanding for running showers during their stay. Thus, there is a growing need that paradigm of the tourism in the new normal should be focusing on creating better places to live first by preserving the traditional style of local communities while they are ready to host the tourists again. In Ladakh, this means restoring the indigenous practices of the local people so that in a world which is suffering from global warming and climate change, we are able to position Ladakh as an ecological paradise which is paving the way for resilience (Nath, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comprehensive network of rural tourism should also be developed wherein the local rural communities are provided with an online platform to sell their products. This will ensure that there is no disruption in the flow of income that is reaching to them in return for their products. For example, the locals who are the owners of the cafes in Himachal Pradesh are selling the ingredients of their dishes like various types of Indian spices that are making its way to the households of the country. Some of the other locals are selling the items like fridge magnets, badges and postcards. People are ordering them to witness these places though virtually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The international organizations like United Nations Development Program (UNDP) must work with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the snow leopard landscapes to engage young people, especially women, to create tourism-led enterprises. These enterprises will not only generate employment for the locals in the region but also provide unique solutions to the challenges, especially in the mountain areas. The major challenges include inaccessibility, fragility and marginality. The creation of the enterprises will overcome these challenges by enhancing connectivity to areas with difficult accessibility as the niche tourism destinations will be emerging. The economic incentives will be provided for the preservation of natural and cultural heritage along with the alternatives to work that typically involves drudgery, such as farming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the tourist destinations are reopening their doors for tourism, the potential travelers must come forward to launch an awareness campaign where they will be making people aware on the measures taken by the local people for coronavirus safety based on their interaction with them along with the significance of supporting the livelihoods of the locals while ensuring that the ecological balance of the environment is not disturbed. When people will hear the experiences of travelers and watch their videos, they will realize the importance of the changing paradigm of tourism towards the slow travel destinations. These destinations will see more people spending time in a single spot as they adapt to the new normal and continue to work from home. This, in turn, will give the incentives to the owners of the guest houses, hostels, hotels and homestays to convert their places into workstations that will provide all the facilities including meals, Wi-Fi connectivity, accommodation while enabling people to continue their work from home. These workspaces are located in some of the stunning new locations in India. People can expand their worldview by traveling to these places as they are the emerging new homes for the digital nomads.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The tourism industry of the country holds an immense potential that needs to be gradually unleashed to create COVID-19 ready destination that is sustainable and resilient in the long run. The destinations will now thrive for achieving the zero-carbon footprint while the enduing proper level of hygiene. The tour operators will be more responsible in sharing the experiences of the local communities to the tourists. Travelers will now have to be more careful while planning their itineraries that will incorporate the ways to deal with the uncertainties as they will step their foot out to embark on a new journey. The traditional philosophies of ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ that we have inherited decades ago will invite our citizens and motivate them to explore our own country.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><em>&#8220;It is very difficult for a woman to make up her mind to enter politics. Once she makes up her own mind then she has to prepare her husband and her children and her family. Once she has overcome all these obstacles and applies for the ticket then the male aspirants against whom she is applying makeup all sorts of stories about her. And after all, this when her name goes to the party bosses, they do not select her name because they fear losing that seat&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The above quote of late Sushma Swaraj gives a glimpse of reality that how women have to face so many <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/why-do-women-not-go-into-politics/">problems and criticisms</a> while entering politics.</p>



<p>Since pre-independence to till now it has been seen that women are always marginalized in the mainstream of politics and in decision making as well as in getting an important position in the political organization and also in our society. But it has been seen that men and women also played an equal role for the development of the nation, they have worked shoulder to shoulder in pre-independent as well as in post-independent India.</p>



<p>Indian constitution is one of the strongest law that provides equal opportunity to both men and women in socio-economic and political aspects. But our societal norms, customs and patriarchal set up treated them as subordinate to men. Their financial dependency upon men also keeps them away from political activities or affiliations. United Nation&#8217;s 2008 survey shows that India marked the lowest number of women&#8217;s participation in parliament i.e. 9.1%. Even a country like UAE marked better than India in the perspective of women&#8217;s participation in parliament i.e. 22.5%. It was seen that the 15th Lok Sabha election has recorded 59 women as a member of parliament highest since independence. India ranked 148 out of the 193 nations with 11.48 percent women in the lower house and 11 percent in the upper house.</p>



<h3>Government Initiatives and Constitutional Provisions</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/women-s-reservation-bill-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-bill-which-is-yet-to-be-passed-in-lok-sabha-1653451-2020-03-07">Women&#8217;s Reservation Bill</a> which allows 33% of reservation for women in the elected bodies but the bill is still reserved in the Lok Sabha after it was passed from the Rajya Sabha. As it has been already stated that the constitution provides equal opportunity to all citizens of India, the constitution also called the state to take measure to neutralize the socio-economic, political, educational and political disadvantages faced by women.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Article 14</strong> &#8211; It guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of law within the territory of India.</li><li><strong>Article 39(b)</strong> &#8211; has provision for equal pay for equal work for both men and women.</li><li><strong>Article 325 and 326</strong> &#8211; They guarantee political equality equal right to participation in political activity and right to vote respectively.</li></ul>



<h3>Success Stories of Indian Women in Politics</h3>



<p>There are many stories of success of Indian women in ancient, medieval as well as in the modern period. It is believed that administration and politics both are the arenas of men. However, in India, we have seen that many women have played and are still playing an important role in both the above-mentioned areas. Late Indira Gandhi has served the nation as the first PM of India and her daughter in law Mrs Sonia Gandhi is the present president of Indian National Congress and was the former chairperson of UPA. The first Indian to serve as the President of the United Nations General Assembly was a woman, Vijay Lakshmi Pandit. States like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir have had women as a chief minister in past. The highest decision making of CPI(M) i.e. Polit Bureau has two women representative out of its thirteen members body.</p>



<p>If we compare between two foremost national parties INC and BJP in respect of giving the nomination to female candidates, it shows that INC nominates more female candidates than BJP. It was in 2009 co-incidentally when both the parties gave the nomination to an equal number of female candidates i.e. 43.</p>



<h3>Obstacles to Women Participation in Politics and the Role of Media in Changing the Societal Mindset</h3>



<p>One of the main obstacles is the societal obstacle. It is mainly believed that the main work of a female is to do household chores and child care and keep herself within the boundary of the house. Managing the outside world is the work of a male. It is also believed that women have a lack of ability in case of giving leadership.</p>



<p>Due to the advancement of news media, print media and social media are playing an important role in changing the mindset of society. Women participating in mainstream politics not just of political awareness but also the role of media in breaking the stereotyped image of women. Undoubtedly media has played a vital role in creating awareness among women and in empowering them up to some extent. Media helps women in identifying and adopting the ways of self-actualization. Women are also becoming active in the journalism profession previously they were seen rarely in journalism. It is also criticized to sensationalize the issues and use women as a commodity for seeking the attention of viewers. Women&#8217;s image is seen as submissive to men. Women&#8217;s issues rarely got space in the leading stories of front pages.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>From the above discussion, we can come to the conclusion that in spite of facing obstacles women in India is coming in the forefront and started demanding their own rights in various fields and many political and apolitical women organizations are acting as their agent in upholding their demands. One of the key thing that acts as an obstacle for women&#8217;s political participation in India is the lack of education. Women will come to know about their rights and privileges when they will get the proper education. With the objective of gender empowerment Government of India in 2014 formed a commission named National Mission of Empowerment of Women, but this project was not up to the mark.</p>



<p>Side by side governmental help is for the uprising of women empowerment. As discussed earlier there are my constitutional provisions which provide equality between men and women. Recently in Kerala, the Sabarimala case is an example of governmental help that provided to the women. For many decades women were not allowed to enter into the Sabarimala temple but the LDF government protested against this and provide the equal right to women as like men to enter into the temple.</p>



<p>Media has to some extent plays an important for women empowerment and truly highlighting their status in society. Establishment of women panchayat and 33% reservation of women into the local bodies is acting as an encouragement to women for taking part in politics and in the decision making process.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Over the years, women have had to fight for many things to find a place in a world primarily run by patriarchal ideals. Women have been conveniently thought of as objects and have been kept away from basic human rights. One such right is the Right to Abortion. Society has a very traditional look towards institutions of marriage and family. Women have been considered suitable only for child-rearing and childbearing. Therefore, the concept of abortion is lost to many. The fight for not only the right to abortion but the acknowledgement of it as a necessity by society and the legal and safe measures taken by the hospitals and clinics has been a part of the feminist discourse since the beginning.</p>



<p>Women’s ability to access safe and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html">legal abortion</a> is prohibited in many countries. Countries that do allow it have poor facilities that hinder women’s health. Apart from this, abortion is not accepted by society and it makes a woman wary of making that choice. Feminists believe that women should be allowed the right to abort because in many cases the pregnancy is a result of rape. They argue that women have the right to decide independently in such matters. They consider the right to abort a human right. It is saddening that 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are due to unsafe abortion. Many women are oftentimes forced to carry a child which further leads to health issues in the mother. In many nations, the act of abortion is has been criminalized by the nation runners and thereby, denied.</p>

<h3><strong>State of Right to Abortion in India</strong></h3>



<p>The nation of India has always seen the concept of abortion as a shameful act, culturally speaking. Despite the societal notions, India seems to have a largely progressive regime for abortion, on <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/is-the-mtp-amendment-bill-really-progressive/">paper</a>. There have been many instances where abortion has been denied to people. Women in India have had to resort to unsafe abortions which ultimately ruin their health and lead to infertility or death in many cases. Most women in India are hardly aware of the concept of abortion and where it is offered. Around 2-4% of women are forced to get abortions in India due to the preference of sons over daughters. In a country like India, the awareness and the act of it has been more like a privilege. Abortion centres are not well-maintained and it reflects the ideals people have about abortion.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/12/03/criminalizing-abortion-constitutional-right/">National Advocates for Pregnant Women</a> (NAPW),  which is a small nonprofit group leading the research and defence of such cases, tabulates that some eight hundred “arrests and equivalent deprivations of liberty” of pregnant women have been made since 2005, for crimes including murder, manslaughter, and foeticide.</p>



<h3><strong>State of Right to Abortion in Poland</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="725" height="482" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12824414-3x2-xlarge.jpg" alt="Anti-Abortion Ban Protests in Poland" class="wp-image-3835" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12824414-3x2-xlarge.jpg 725w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12824414-3x2-xlarge-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption>Anti-Abortion Ban Protests in Poland | Source:<em> Reuters (Tomasz Pietrzyk/Agencja Gazeta)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Recently, the Constitution in Poland has <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-polish-women-are-protesting-a-recent-court-ruling-on-abortions-6883121/">ruled </a>that an existing law allowing abortion of malformed foetuses unconstitutional. This has provoked an outcry from women and pro-choice activists. The tribunal’s president Julia Przylebska said that permitting abortions in the case of fetal deformities legalized “eugenic practices concerning an unborn child, thus denying it the respect and protection of human dignity.” Since the Polish constitution assures a right to life, Przylebska argued that an abortion based on a fetal malfunction was “a directly forbidden form of discrimination.”</p>



<p>Before the ruling, Poland had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/world/europe/poland-abortion-ruling-protests.html">permitted </a>abortion in three scenarios: for fetal abnormalities, in the case of a threat to a woman’s health, and the case of incest or rape. But, the latest court rulings argued that abortion due to abnormal fetal abnormalities is unconstitutional, which stirred up unrest among the people. Since the ruling, protesters have gathered around demanding a reversal of the ruling.</p>



<h3><strong>State of Right to Abortion in the USA</strong></h3>



<p>In the first months of this year, nearly 30 states in the United States introduced an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47940659">abortion ban</a>. Fifteen of these states have been working to pass bills that will ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Earlier in May, Alabama lawmakers passed a bill to ban abortion entirely and Missouri&#8217;s sole abortion clinic remains engrossed in a legal battle to keep its operating license from the state health department. If they lose, Missouri will become the only US state without an abortion clinic.</p>



<p>The US movement against abortion has been raging since the 1800s.&nbsp; It has largely been led by Catholics and conservative religious groups. Ever since the abortion ban was introduced, many people, especially women have protested against this decision. Celebrities have been seen taking to social media to express their anger. Many celebrities have decided to stop working in the states which have completely banned abortion. Disney has decided to quit Georgia over abortion law and “Netflix” has decided to rethink its operations in Georgia.</p>



<h3><strong>The Fight for the Right to Abortion Continues</strong></h3>



<p>Most believe that the right to abort is a human right and the decision to abort should be solely given to women who are the child-bearers. Throughout this fight, we have seen the various governments picking out specific parts of the concept of abortion and creating opinions but what they fail to understand is that, at the end of the day, women are the ones bearing the child and they are on the receiving end of the consequences stemming out from unwanted pregnancies. Banning abortion entirely or allowing it only for specific reasons which may be acceptable to only a group of law-makers is only another way to oppress women.</p>



<p>The fight for abortion has been an age-old fight. Many generations of women have led movements against any government banning abortion. Even in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, when women are being told what to do, how to use their body and whether or not to carry children in their wombs, it largely feels like women are losing the long-fought battle against the ban of abortion. The importance of the right to abortion and the need for proper clinics that follow all medical protocols are not yet known to the people. The way people look at it gives us a peek at the devastating condition of women in the world and makes the fight difficult every day.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Though the Indo-Taiwanese relationship has been ignored for long, this is a ripe moment for a recalibration for these natural allies who share democratic values, uphold the rule of law, human rights and a rules-based international order. The revanchist dragon has been attempting to bully both India and Taiwan in the South Asian region and this provides a mutual antagonism against Beijing that can be used to secure better bilateral strategic and security cooperation between both. Moreover, Taiwan has showcased itself as a responsible and outward-looking state which has effectively handled the pandemic domestically while also providing medical supplies to around 80 countries, including India. Expansionist and belligerent China needs to be tackled effectively by these two states and their cooperation needs to be strengthened, both, at the level of multilateral institutions, as well as bilaterally.</p>



<p>Though there has been a lack of political enthusiasm, the common threat of irking China and structural issues that have acted as obstacles for blossoming Indo-Taiwanese relations, Taiwan has engaged silently diplomatically in India. PM Narendra Modi and President Tsai Ing-wen, have engaged in furthering the bilateral relationship.</p>



<h3><strong>Contextualising the Indo-Taiwanese Relationship</strong></h3>



<p>The Indo-Taiwanese relations were almost non-existent for more than four decades after the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was recognised by India. Marking the beginning of their &#8216;unofficial&#8217; ties,&nbsp; in 1992, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) set up a liaison office in Mumbai and, in 1995, India opened its representative office in Taipei and named it the India-Taipei Association (ITA) for economic engagement. In a month, Taiwan opened its office in New Delhi and called it the <a href="https://www.roc-taiwan.org/in_en/post/4.html">Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre</a> (TECC). Now, the TECC offices are operational in Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai. Although they were not formal diplomatic missions, they do function as de-facto representatives of their respective governments and carry out activities like issuing of visas, carrying out trade and economic relations and facilitating people-to-people contacts. This was the beginning of bettering bilateral relations between India and Taiwan in the sphere of trade and commerce, development and research, science and technology, education, people-to-people contacts, and other related fields and thus, in the post Cold-War period, this marked an important watershed moment in the history of Indo-Taiwanese relationship. This was a pointer towards India’s ‘Look East Policy’, enunciated by the then Prime Minister, Narasimha Rao and was a marker of Taiwan’s pragmatic diplomacy.</p>



<p>Taiwan’s ‘pragmatic diplomacy’ is also known as ‘flexible diplomacy’ and ‘substantive diplomacy’ and focuses on enhancing its international profile and facilitating its external engagements by using &#8216;unofficial&#8217; and &#8216;non-diplomatic&#8217; channels in the broader economic and cultural arenas, without attempting conventional state-to-state diplomacy, so as not to invite ire from the PRC. New Delhi, in this context, has emerged as a significant factor for Taiwan’s substantive diplomatic practices. <strong><mark><em>Given their shared concerns vis-à-vis China and the commonality of their democratic values, especially during the current strategic uncertainty, this seems like the perfect ripe moment to enhance relations between the two.</em></mark></strong></p>



<p>In 2014, Taiwan’s representative to India had attended PM Modi’s swearing-in ceremony, and in 2016, India carefully well thought-out sending a representative to President Tsai’s inauguration but eventually decided against it. Most countries, including India, have found it challenging to balance the political and strategic implications of fostering closer relations with Taiwan due to the uncertainty of China’s reaction, leading to a complex diplomatic maze. In this context, Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy (NSP) under Tsai Ing-wen seeks to expand links with countries across South and Southeast Asia with a great emphasis on building economic, investment and people-to-people ties, as well as a greater focus on India especially while New Delhi “acts east”. Given the swaying relationship between India and Mainland China, it is practical for India to shift towards greater stress on soft balancing by cultivating a fruitful relationship with Taiwan. The Indian government’s ‘Act East Policy’ provides for greater engagement between India and Southeast Asia, making Taiwan important for India’s future economic growth.</p>



<p>In terms of increasing economic and commercial engagement, the TECC and the ITA formalized an MoU in 2017 on the “Promotion of Industry Collaboration”, preceded by twenty-one MoUs signed earlier that year by Taiwan’s Chinese National Federation of Industries and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In 2018, the first India-Taiwan Trade Forum was convened in Taipei with the Taipei World Trade Center inaugurating its New Delhi office in conjunction with the debut of the Taiwan Expo (a business exposition) in South Asia over the summer of 2018 with New Delhi serving as its inaugural venue. Despite all these developments on the economic front, there have been domestic and structural problems in formalising the relationship, especially due to New Delhi’s position on acknowledging the ‘One-China policy’. New Delhi has overall remained ambiguous on the matter and the investment and trade have remained relatively modest but there have been efforts to increase investment by Taiwanese firms in India and notable joint initiatives and manufacturing clusters have been proposed under the ‘Make in India’ campaign.</p>

<h3><strong>Upgrading the Relationship: QUAD Angle</strong></h3>



<p>The need of the hour for India is focusing on a practical and long term pragmatic approach for fomenting better ties with Taiwan. We have to strategically balance the ‘One-China policy’ of Mainland China (based on one country, two systems model) and cultivating a beneficial and normal relationship with Taipei. New Delhi should not use Taiwan as a pressure point or Achilles Heel against the PRC as this hampers India’s goals and Taiwan’s development. The focal point for bettering the Indo-Taiwanese relationship should be based on enhancing people-to-people, cultural and business exchanges rather than focusing on the government-to-government gimmicks. Education, tourism and technological innovations can leverage the relationship. India should actively engage with Taiwanese NGOs to create an impact over the coming years and focus on roping in an international networking capacity. Small and medium-sized enterprises too can act as significant job creation initiatives and serve as great vehicles to exchange knowledge and human capital. Taiwan can also help in meeting India’s agricultural modernisation needs and its recent support during the pandemic in healthcare facilities is a pointer in the direction of up-gradation of the relationship in a pragmatic understanding. <strong><em><mark>This soft power diplomacy through developmental assistance, cultural, healthcare, academic and tourist exchanges will surely benefit and give a thrust to long term robust India-Taiwan relations.</mark></em></strong></p>



<p>There have been under-utilised opportunities in the bilateral relationship. New Delhi needs to engage in proper policy approach to benefit most from a healthy relationship with the core area of the Chinese economy. The reshaping of the relationship with Taiwan has not only been a prerogative of New Delhi, the other three members of the QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue): USA, Australia and Japan have also upgraded their relations with Taipei.</p>



<p>Taiwan is significant for the QUAD countries as it is the core area that can be used to deter Chinese aggression due to its strategic location and partnership with the QUAD countries would act as a diplomatic weapon for both parties against the belligerent Dragon’s ever-rising provocations. Moreover, it is an important source of information on China, as evidenced in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the QUAD needs to protect Taiwan from diplomatic isolation and help it develop its military and defensive capabilities while also providing it opportunities for investment in a safe and incentive-based environment in the QUAD so that they can safely relocate their economic and investment ventures from Mainland China without incurring losses.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>India needs to act in a strategic manner and shed its inhibitions and self-imposed restraint on engaging with Taiwan. The bilateral relationship is extremely rewarding if managed appropriately by both parties. They have to act more decisively and New Delhi has to formally acknowledge Taiwan as a development partner and the role it can play in steering the direction of Indo-Taiwanese relationship. It is an opportune moment, also thus for the QUAD to recognise Taiwan as a reliable partner and counter China’s growing footprint in South Asia that it wants to establish its hegemony over, through its bellicose and pugnacious ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Although the Constitution of India preaches equality among the citizens without any discrimination based on their caste, religion, gender, etc, the people of India are far from practising this entity. People are heavily looked down upon due to their caste or gender affiliations. There are many minority communities in India and worldwide, which are discriminated against based on their affiliations and nature. The LGBTQ community happens to be one of them and within them, the trans community are people who have been completely shunned out of society because of their inability to conform to the binary ideas of gender that are acceptable by society.</p>



<p>The trans community, owing to their difference in nature, have been seen as a threat to the core foundation of gender in society. Members of the trans community are collectively called <em>hijras</em>. Most people do not understand the meaning of the term <em>hijra</em> and use it in a derogatory sense. They do not get significant jobs because of the perception that they are unable to perform any. Being a parent of a transgender child is considered shameful and members of trans community are not allowed to marry and bear children.</p>



<p>Since most people in the Indian society and the global arena fail to understand the heterogeneity of gender, they see such trans persons as a threat to the traditions and culture and try to remove them from the society. Shunned, these people are not provided with any basic human, political, and civil rights and do not have any access to the necessities. They also have no access to education or healthcare.</p>



<p>The main issue with the <a href="https://medium.com/one-future/the-challenges-faced-by-transpersons-in-india-fa46575ca14d">Indian Education System</a> is that they don’t facilitate skill acquisition. While moving further up, many students drop out, which creates a learning gap. Trans persons fall under this category. Many trans students are subject to a lot of bullying owing to their nature, which leads them to drop out of schools and colleges or committing suicide. In India, schools and colleges are not sensitive to trans people. The University Grants Commission and the Central and State Education Boards have to make more policies inclusive of them and make sure that these policies are implemented and that the bullying of the trans students is stopped immediately to facilitate their education.</p>



<p>Another benefit that is not accessible to trans people is healthcare. Trans people are often refused care from various health services. They also face harassment and physical attacks in the hospitals which in turn makes them skeptical to take the help of hospitals and doctors. Many are admitted to hospitals and left untreated. This kind of behavior has scared them and forces them to stay away from healthcare institutions. Apart from this, since they are also derived from education, they are unaware of a lot of important health care benefits and treatments that should be accessible to people in general and them.</p>



<p>Besides these, they are constantly ridiculed and discriminated against, which results in identity issues. They also go through a lifetime of poverty and are subject to human trafficking. They are subject to unemployment and homelessness.</p>



<p>Through time, the trans community, after being an integral part of the LGBTQ community, has protested against this injustice and discrimination. This had made the government create some policies and laws for the trans community.</p>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court of India <a href="https://dhyeyaias.com/current-affairs/perfect-7-magazine/transgender-related-issues">recognized </a>the third gender along with the primary genders of ‘male’ and ‘female’. This decision has successfully shattered the dual-gender structure of “male” and “female” that is usually recognized by society.</li><li>The Supreme Court has given certain directions for the protection of the rights of the trans persons by including them in documents like the election card, passport, driving license and ration card, and for admission in educational institutions, hospitals, amongst others.</li><li>Articles 15, 16, and 21, do not allow the violation of discrimination on the grounds of gender.</li><li>The Court recognized the right of an individual to choose how to behave in private and allowed them the means needed to reach their full potential. The Court noted that a person will not realize his abilities and interests if he is forced to accept a gender assigned to him at birth. He should thereby be given the freedom to choose for himself to reach his full potential.</li><li>The Court also protects an individual’s gender expression invoked by Article 19 (1) (a). It upholds that “no restriction can be placed on one’s appearance or choice of dressing subject to the restrictions contained in article 19(2) of the Constitution”.</li><li>Human rights were awarded to them which includes the right to life, liberty, equality, dignity, and freedom of thought and expression.</li><li><strong>The decriminalization of Section 377 of IPC</strong>&nbsp;is also a colossal step for solving transgender issues.</li></ul>



<p>The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019 was passed on November 26, 2019, by the Parliament. It is the revised version of the Bill that was passed in 2016 and 2018. The previous Bills were heavily criticized for various reasons, one being that they were not at par with the Supreme Court judgment in National Legal Services Authority. The 2019 Bill attempted to define someone whose gender does not match the one assigned at birth. This bill included transgender persons in the Constitution, thereby including them in our society and providing them with legal human rights. It also prohibited any kind of discrimination and harassment based on an individual’s gender.</p>



<p><strong>The provisions of this bill are:</strong></p>



<ul><li>It <a href="https://dhyeyaias.com/current-affairs/perfect-7-magazine/transgender-related-issues">recognizes </a>the 3rd gender after the Supreme Court ruled in the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) judgment that the third gender should be legally recognized.</li><li>It defines a transgender as someone who is partly female or male or a combination of female and male or neither female nor male. It advocates that the person&#8217;s gender must not match the gender assigned at birth. It includes trans-men, trans-women, persons with intersex variations, and gender-queers.</li><li>The government must provide the necessary support, like rehabilitation, self-employment, and healthcare.</li><li>The bill prohibits discrimination and harassment against members of trans community and protects them from any kind of violence.</li><li>A strict penalty has been assigned against discrimination, either in public or in private.</li><li>It holds that the members of the trans community must obtain identity proof which is provided by the district magistrate (DM) on the recommendations of medical experts, government officials, and one other transgender.</li><li>A National Council for transgenders is to be set up to protect their interests.</li></ul>



<p>In time, many states have taken certain measures to make the lives of transgenders easy. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li>Odisha categorized transgenders under the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category which now enables the community to avail of socio-economic benefits, which might otherwise be out of their reach.</li><li>Tamil Nadu constituted the Aravanis Welfare Board in 2008 for providing a pension for the community.</li><li>Kerala came out with a Transgender Policy to help transgenders.</li></ul>



<p>This bill too has been criticized by many and has been a topic of debate and discussion.</p>



<p>The reason why the Transgender Protection Bill was due to the efforts of the LGBTQ Community whose aim was to ensure equality in our society. Yes, this monumental change of the Supreme Court acknowledging the transgenders as any other human is celebratory but we cannot forget that in a world of trillions, some people who do not understand or accept anything other than the binary ideals of gender still walk the earth and attempt to make the lives of such people difficult. Even though the Constitution has passed the Protection of Rights Bill, many civil servants refuse to help transgenders and indulge in violent activities because they do not accept the bill or the existence of such persons. Members of the trans community are still subject to the same amount of harassment as before, if not more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the transgender community such as Revathi and Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi have openly spoken about their struggles in their autobiographies to show the world the kind of harassment that every transgender person has to face in today’s world. While many succumb to these inhuman challenges, people like Lakshmi and Revathi have not only fought their battles but are now helping millions of other transgender&#8217;s fight as well. Many non-profit organizations have also dedicated themselves to help such people. The usage of terms such as “coming out” or using the term as a <em>hijra</em> only for insults, shows the deep-rooted hatred for such people among us and while many transgenders are moving up in society, the social issues that they face since birth are still probable in society. While the mindset of people is slowly changing, whether a complete change will ever be possible is a point of debate among scholars today. As citizens of India, we should all accept this natural entity even if we fail to understand the mechanisms of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Diasporas in the recent times have emerged as powerful entities in the realm of ‘soft power’ foreign policy strategy and as an agent or catalyst of economic development in the countries of origin apart from their active role in the host countries. Diasporas have a unique role in international relations and foreign policy because they act as a link between two countries, “sharing in two cultures, having an emotional investment in two nations, and preserving social connections in two societies.”</p>



<p>Due to the globalisation and liberalisation of global economies coupled with the rapid advancement in science and communication technologies, there has been an intensification of their socio-economic, political and cultural ties with their countries of origin. Diasporas have attained due importance at the international level as well as in the domestic political and economic affairs of home countries in the present scenario. <mark>They have started acting as an ‘inevitable link’ between their home and host lands resulting in major political and economic implications for both.</mark></p>



<h3>Diaspora as a Tool of Diplomacy in India&#8217;s Foreign Policy</h3>



<p>The use of diaspora as a tool of diplomacy in Indian Foreign Policy is a relatively new phenomenon. The Indian diaspora is a major component of these concomitant worldwide and has increasingly become more influential over India’s foreign policy, becoming a highly strategic asset for India in the recent decades. India has been making concerted efforts to engage and leverage upon its diaspora estimated to be about 25 million, the second largest in the world, ranging from a mere 20 in Albania to over 2.2 million in the United States, dispersed in 136 countries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3681" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min-1170x658.jpeg 1170w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-10.16.19-AM-min.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump addressing Indian-Americans at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The efforts of PM Modi regarding Diaspora Diplomacy and in cultivating the relationship with Indian diaspora signifies the importance of soft power in the foreign policy initiatives of the present government. To be fair, diaspora cultivation is not exactly a new phenomenon in IFP; the former governments had also invested a good amount of capital in resolving the underlying obstacles in the implementation of effective interaction between Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) with the Indian government.  </p>



<p>The union government in the year 2000 established a high-level committee on Indian diaspora to review the status of People of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) looking at the laws and rules that are applicable to them. This was an initiative to look at the role NRIs and PIOs may play in the social, economic and technological development of India.&nbsp; Better rules favouring the PIOs like the ease of travel and stay were implemented and new categories created amongst its diaspora in 2006 for the NRIs, PIOs and Overseas Citizen of India (OCIs). The Indian parliament in August 2005, passed the amendment of Citizenship Act of 1955, allowing certain sections of the diaspora to gain specific citizenship rights. Eventually, there is a growth in outreach activities for the Indian diaspora like conferences and seminars, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (Day of Indians Abroad) amongst other initiatives which show a concerted effort by the Government of India to showcase India as a place that is welcoming of its diaspora.</p>



<h3>Diasporas: Effective Instrument in India&#8217;s Foreign Policy</h3>



<p>The importance of diasporas does not end with remittances alone. It extends to knowledge transfer, the sharing of resources, diasporas acting as unofficial Indian ambassadors and pushing for India&#8217;s interests abroad. The diaspora has also helped in improving India’s image globally and they undoubtedly have considerable stakes in India’s development.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Diaspora is the oxygen to PM Modi’s foreign policy. Since day one, he has addressed concerns related to the Indian diaspora and makes it a point to address a gathering of Indian diaspora at any foreign visit. The task of such an interaction is to convince the diaspora that they can engage as effective stakeholders in the problems faced by India and that their contribution is imperative for India’s economic development and its rise as a global power. This also acts as a subtle but powerful message to the governments of the host countries. This “Diaspora Diplomacy” is a classic example of how the diaspora can act as an effective instrument of diplomacy in international affairs in the era of globalisation. The diaspora can greatly contribute to domestic economic development and attract FDI to India. Modi’s idea of diaspora diplomacy is to ensure a collective Indian voice in the host countries where they are simultaneously loyal citizens. While the diaspora certainly do not determine policy, they can effectively shape it and act as “bridge-builders” between their home and host countries.</p>

<p>While looking at the effect of diaspora Diplomacy in Indian Foreign Policy, some examples can be cited as diaspora plays a decisive role in the improvement of India’s foreign relations. Historically, India has benefitted from its diaspora. Two instances stand out: lobbying for the US-India Civilian Nuclear Agreement Bill in 2008 and their remittance inflow. The Indo-American community had a significant role to play in improving the image of Indians in the American minds as well as the Indo-US rapprochement. The lobbying efforts of the US India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) helped to get the Indo-US Nuclear Deal passed by the US Congress. While Bollywood films since Independence have enjoyed great popularity in the Middle East, the development of geo-economics has made the Indian diaspora as an important instrument, interest and indicator of India’s soft power in the region. The Indian expats working in the region contribute significantly to the remittances India receives. PM Modi has capitalised on the need for Middle Eastern countries to look for large markets because of the Shale Revolution and US Retrenchment, increasing India’s engagement with the region. The most important tool for PM Modi’s Middle East adventures has been the Indian diaspora.</p>



<p>However, certain political developments taking place within India do sometimes negatively impact the diaspora, for example, the negative impact of the diaspora is that there are also groups and individuals within the diaspora who continue to support various insurgent groups operating within India, while lending them both moral and material support through hawala operations, money laundering etc. and this can prove to be a colossal security threat for the nation.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, India has a pivotal role to play in world affairs as it is a rising power and a key stakeholder in the security dynamics of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Its role in East Asia is taking shape and while India is still not an economic power, its military capabilities, shared interests and willingness to explore beyond its rhetoric have raised expectations banking on its capabilities and the role India can play as an Asian power, in the region and globally. The large populations of Indian expatriates in countries like Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia provide India with an opportunity to develop nurturing and more cooperative relations in the region. In the past, diaspora policies have been inconsistent and often poorly implemented, to say in the least. Over the years, however, the diaspora populations have become an increasingly important factor in international relations and politics. The Indian diaspora have a direct engagement and influence on the economies and polities of both the origin country and the host country. This provides for a ripe environment for India to tap on the potential they offer.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>However, the present foreign-policy strategy of a strong outreach to the Indian diaspora stands out and must be nurtured. The diaspora can provide the requisite strategic impulse and strengthen strategic relations. &nbsp;In the present times, the global reach of media and revolutionary changes in communication has helped create diaspora networks and instant connectivity with the motherland. It is important to constantly engage the diaspora and develop policies as the destinies of India and the diaspora are intertwined. Therefore, it serves the interest of both to develop a mutually beneficial relationship and is an important tool for India’s soft power diplomacy which would help India in achieving its aspirations to be a developed country and a knowledge superpower in the international arena.</p>
