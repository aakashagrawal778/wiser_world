										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Saudi Arabia under the initiative of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave women in the kingdom the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/womens-rights-in-the-islamic-world/a-40714427">right to drive</a>. Saudi Arabia has been the only country in the world to prohibit women from driving &#8211; a universally perceived image of inequality. Alongside with the ability to drive has come new rights and freedoms: the ability to join the military, work in intelligence services and attend sporting events and concerts. A senior cleric even commented that women should not be required to wear the abaya. Saudi Arabia is following some great people&#8217;s example. Over the Middle East and North Africa, nations have been updating women’s right. Since 2011, almost every nation in North Africa has adopted a gender quota, in which parties are required to nominate a minimum percentage of women as candidates for office, to increase women’s representation in politics. In Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, Yemen and Morocco, women can now pass on citizenship to their children, and Lebanon may soon join this list. The region has seen the widespread repeal of laws letting rapists escape punishment if they marry their victims and nine countries adopted laws against domestic violence.&nbsp;The rights to education and employment plus women’s activism make a big difference in women’s rights.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Feminism isn’t about making women stronger. Women are already strong; it’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength</em>&#8221; </p><cite><em>&#8211; G.D. Anderson&nbsp;</em></cite></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Women and Islam</strong></h3>



<p>In Islam, men and women are moral equals in God&#8217;s sight and are expected to fulfil the same duties of worship, prayer, faith, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca. Islam by and large improved the status of ladies contrasted with before Arab societies, restricting female child murder and perceiving ladies&#8217; full personhood. Islamic law stresses the authoritative idea of marriage, necessitating that a dowry is paid to the woman and not her family, and ensuring women&#8217;s rights of inheritance and to claim and oversee the property. Women were additionally allowed the option to live in the marital home and get monetary maintenance during marriage and a holding up period following demise and separation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510">Historical records</a> show that Muhammad counselled ladies and gauged their opinions seriously. Umm Waraqah was selected imam over the family unit by Muhammad. Women contributed altogether to the canonization of the Quran. A lady is known to have adjusted the definitive decision of Caliph Umar on the endowment. Women prayed in mosques unsegregated from men, were involved in hadith transmission, gave sanctuary to men, engaged in commercial transactions were encouraged to seek knowledge, and were both instructors and pupils in the early Islamic period. Muhammad&#8217;s last wife, Aishah, was a well-known authority in medicine, history, and rhetoric. Caliph Umar named ladies to fill in as authorities in the market of Medina. Life stories of recognized ladies, particularly in Muhammad&#8217;s family unit, show that ladies acted moderately independently in early Islam. In Sufi circles, ladies were perceived as educators, followers, &#8220;otherworldly moms,&#8221; and even inheritors of the profound privileged insights of their fathers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No woman held religious titles in Islam, but many women held political power, some jointly with their husbands, others independently. The best-known women rulers in the premodern era include Khayzuran, who governed the Muslim Empire under three Abbasid caliphs in the eighth century; Malika Asma bint Shihab al-Sulayhiyya and Malika Arwa bint Ahmad al-Sulayhiyya, who both held power in Yemen in the eleventh century; Sitt al-Mulk, a Fatimid queen of Egypt in the eleventh century; the Berber queen Zaynab al-Nafzawiyah (r. 1061 – 1107 ); two thirteenth-century Mamluk queens, Shajar al-Durr in Cairo and Radiyyah in Delhi; six Mongol queens, including Kutlugh Khatun (thirteenth century) and her daughter Padishah Khatun of the Kutlugh-Khanid dynasty; the fifteenth-century Andalusian queen Aishah al-Hurra, known by the Spaniards as Sultana Madre de Boabdil; Sayyida al-Hurra, governor of Tetouán in Morocco (r. 1510 – 1542 ); and four seventeenth-century Indonesian queens.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the status of women in premodern Islam all in all adjusted not to Quranic beliefs however to prevailing patriarchal cultural norms. Thus, improvement of the status of ladies turned into a significant issue in the present day, reformist Islam.</p>



<p><strong>The rights to education and employment plus <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/women-of-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/">women’s activism</a> make a big difference in women’s rights.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/23/womens-rights-are-advancing-in-the-middle-east-this-explains-why/">“Myths About Women’s Rights: How, Where and Why Rights Advance,”</a> Feryal Cherif, analyses two hypotheses for why cultures advance gender equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is the thing that we call &#8220;centre rights&#8221;: that women’s rights to education and employment are the structure hinders with which to begin political organizing for equality, developing a group sense of fairness (or the lack thereof), and building public support for women’s equal socioeconomic standing. This gives government officials, and other residential elites motivations to help ladies&#8217; privileges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The subsequent hypothesis is that ladies&#8217; privileges backing cultivates change as local and worldwide activists advance new standards of uniformity by publicizing countries&#8217; practices — both those that treat ladies similarly and those that slack — and constraining governments to adjust to worldwide norms. Research shows that these hypotheses are steady with the ongoing advances in gender equality in Saudi Arabia and the region at large. Looking at ladies&#8217; property rights in 41 Muslim-larger part nations, I believe that women are probably going to appreciate safer property rights in nations where, first, women have more prominent admittance to education and second, where there are thick systems of women rights activists. Where ladies are more mindful of their privileges, better situated to challenge male family, and have the socioeconomic power to hold politicians accountable, their property rights are stronger. That is valid also for the Saudi Arabian development of women’s rights, including the right to drive. It is presumably not a happenstance that, throughout the long term, the hole between Saudi Arabian boys’ and girls’ education has considerably limited. Furthermore, it&#8217;s actually in numerous other Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) nations, where young ladies beat young men in school and enrol in universities at higher rates than boys. Besides, an expanding number of Arab ladies have joined the work power — though not yet at levels as high as worldwide midpoints. Indeed, even in Saudi Arabia, with its extraordinary forms of gender segregation, ladies are working in an ever-increasing number of fields. Also, with the right to drive, more women will be able to seek employment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to core rights, women rights activism has additionally considerably expanded in the Middle East and North Africa in the previous decades. During 1980 and 2015, the number of women rights groups operating in the region nearly tripled. Some scholars and reporters have argued that advocacy campaigns and global pressure have helped push MENA nations toward gender equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, even in conservative states like Saudi Arabia, the government may think that it’s hard to contain women’s expectations once they&#8217;ve been educated and entered the work power — even while more traditionalist pieces of their country push back.</p>



<h3><strong>Political Participation</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="394" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-10.png" alt="WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD" class="wp-image-3050" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-10.png 750w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-10-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image_article/public/Egypt%2520vote_0.jpg?itok=SBdUTTBo">MEI</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/political-empowerment-for-women-in-the-middle-east/">Political revolutions</a> and instability in the Middle East have mobilized women in new ways. Despite political turmoil and express dangers to their privileges, numerous ladies are expanding their activism to make their voices heard. Because of this flood of political commitment from ladies, however, fundamentalist and traditionalist pioneers and governments are pushing back, increasing their assaults on women’s human rights with an end goal to keep up their power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though, when women do win rights, they aren&#8217;t able to execute them since they are sabotaged by solid accepted practices and conventions. For instance, although women in Egypt have cast ballot rights, the Egyptian Association for Community Participation Enhancement (which conducts customary political race checking) has discovered that in provincial towns, spouses, fathers, or siblings will advise women how to cast a ballot—or even just take a women’s polling form from her and round it out however they see fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laws in the area, including both old laws and ongoing ones, confine ladies&#8217; common freedoms and fill in as unequivocal proof that people with significant influence don&#8217;t consider women equals. For instance, in 2014 the Iraqi parliament introduced a draft law that endeavoured to make it lawful to wed a young girl as young as nine years of age, granting conjugal assault, and allowing polygamy. A long-standing law in Lebanon doesn&#8217;t permit women to pass on their citizenship, implying that if a Lebanese lady weds a non-Lebanese man, her children wouldn’t have Lebanese citizenship. Also, fundamentalist gatherings are a ground-breaking and developing danger, with systems that straightforwardly target women, including the abduction and forced sexual slavery of Yazidi ladies in Iraq by the alleged Islamic State gathering (ISIS). With so many powerful forces opposing women’s human rights in the Middle East, many in the region feel that international support has been far too weak. Leaders of women’s groups across the region stress the need for international support and solidarity. Past budgetary help, women likewise call for worldwide solidarity and expressions of help, referring to the two sorts of help as basic to opposing fundamentalism. Women’s gatherings keep up that while fundamentalist dangers against women’s rights are at the moment most powerful in the Middle East, the issue is, in fact, a global problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">In the 41<sup>st</sup> session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), <a href="https://ap.ohchr.org/Documents/E/HRC/c_gov/A_HRC_41_G_11.DOCX">22 countries</a> (mostly western)  condemned China&#8217;s mass detention of the Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minority groups. Unpredictably, just a few days later, <a href="https://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=32880">37 countries</a> (mostly from Asia and Africa) responded with a&nbsp;letter&nbsp;to the United Nations praising China&#8217;s efforts towards restoring human rights. According to the&nbsp;document, no terrorist attacks have taken place in the previously problematic region for the last three years due to China&#8217;s effective measures for counter-terrorism. Fast forward to the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/which-countries-support-the-new-hong-kong-national-security-law/">44<sup>th</sup> session</a> of the UNHRC, 53 countries backed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/hong-kongs-new-security-law-the-end-of-hong-kong/">Beijing&#8217;s new national security law for Hong Kong</a>. Just 27 criticized the law, which imposes harsh penalties for imprecisely defined crimes and is widely viewed as the final blow for Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy.</p>



<h3><strong>Modern Genocide</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since the summer of 2017, we have been hearing frequently from the world media and human rights organisations, appalling reports of ginormous<strong> internment of people</strong>. Most of them who have been arbitrarily detained are Uyghur (a primarily Turkic-speaking Muslim minority ethnic group), Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). According to the latest Chinese <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011101904/http:/www.xjtj.gov.cn/sjcx/tjnj_3415/2016xjtjnj/rkjy/201707/t20170714_539450.html">census</a>, the population of Uyghurs is about&nbsp;12&nbsp;million. However, sources indicate that their population is undercounted by the Chinese authorities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1-1024x742.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2020" width="518" height="375" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1-1024x742.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1-300x218.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1-768x557.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1-1536x1114.jpg 1536w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Uygur-Autonomous-Region-of-Xinjiang-China-min-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Since 2017, eight hundred thousand to two million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities have vanished into an extensive network of <strong>“re-education camps”</strong>. Forcing the detainees to repudiate Islam and espouse the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seems to be the ultimate goal for the government. Former detainees reported <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/world_report_download/hrw_world_report_2019.pdf">mandatory classes</a> where they were required to recite Communist slogans and praise the CCP. Some reported the rampant presence of cameras and microphones without any blind spots monitoring their every move. Women have shared&nbsp;stories of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/abortions-iuds-and-sexual-humiliation-muslim-women-who-fled-china-for-kazakhstan-recount-ordeals/2019/10/04/551c2658-cfd2-11e9-a620-0a91656d7db6_story.html">sexual abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53220713">forced abortions</a> and having contraceptive devices implanted against their will.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Initially, China denied the existence of such camps. But once <a href="https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3a5af29dc357b4ce1fa30b8f35b0cbead1637e8d-1582219933-0-ARZeR3RcUIJ4BbhuKPH9HwVeQ_xEGD8UuYIwKl8d4kX7mZZo74aW3akiGbgRCmjnmze445Qb_vRZulsD4B1O8l2DGJEtJTneEOijFgA4dkJ9P2H9XXrUZobDFf01eiAXEHQGb8zJavwVgTdqFz7o_xPQJiv9e1PkTtDB59Biafv7wbHaF6DONQxnkYVp32e5lRoY1776spYhiW1bZvFMLT8blKaaLMMD4vRz8KPfYF7ADyy2Nji9e0kyvjTv096o21HBRDTAoAxMEuZiW6mPQEHeUgtmLl37ObXI_31IuVzI">evidence</a> started to mount with pictures, videos and testimonies, they changed their narrative and asserted that these internment camps were <strong>“vocational education centers”</strong> designed to help young, unemployed people in Xinjiang to learn job skills and the Chinese language, concealing the fact that the middle-aged population is almost wiped out in southern Xinjiang. Till date, China doesn’t accept that any human rights violation is taking place. It holds that the <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/16/c_137535821.htm?mc_cid=ace3de327f&amp;mc_eid=c8292ef9bf">purpose</a> of the camps is to get rid of the environment that breeds <strong>terrorism and religious extremism.</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Outside of the camps, Uyghurs have continued to suffer from a long clampdown by Chinese authorities. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/china0519_web.pdf">Surveillance</a> is intrusive and ubiquitous making it one of the most heavily surveilled police state in the world. Muslims are being forced to accept Communist Party officials in their homes, effectively extending state surveillance everywhere. <a href="http://www.bt.chinanews.com/bingtuan/20171211/8699.shtml">1.1 million local government officials</a> have been stationed to spend about a week every two months living in the home of a Uyghur host family. It is referred to as the <strong>“Pair Up and Become Family”</strong> campaign. Additionally, each square has a police station that closely monitors the locals through regularly scanning their ID cards and searching their mobile phones.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Fleeing out of China is not enough to escape the rule of CCP. In 2017, Uyghurs worldwide reported being contacted by Chinese police and were ordered to return home. Those who obeyed often disappeared and those who did not, received calls from family members begging them to repatriate for the fear of detention. It also coerced many countries into returning Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups to China. In 2015, Thailand returned<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/thailand-returns-uighurs-china-150709080144676.html"> nearly 100 Uyghurs</a>. In July 2017, Egyptian authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/egypt-muslims-uighurs-deportations-xinjiang-china.html">deported two dozen Uyghurs</a>, who instantaneously disappeared on arrival in China. In some cases, like Malaysia, foreign governments resisted Chinese pressure, often through the support of the United States and refused to return Uyghur individuals.</p>



<h3><strong>The Organ Scandal</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that it had performed the <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1181228.shtml">first double transplant</a> on a 59-year-old after her lungs failed due to coronavirus. The fact that the patient had to wait for <strong>merely five days for a donor to provide a perfectly matching set of lungs</strong> while the world’s waiting time for a single lung could be months and even years, raises doubts about the legitimacy of the organ harvesting program. These suspicions are being raised because China has a voluntary donor rate of only 0.6 per one million citizens. Of the 1.5 million Chinese citizens who are in need of an organ transplant donor each year, only 10,000 receive a successful match, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820883/">Journal of Biomedical Research</a>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <a href="https://chinatribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ChinaTribunal_-SummaryJudgment_17June2019.pdf">Final Judgement</a> of Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China given on 1<sup>st </sup>March 2020 declares, “Forced organ harvesting has happened in multiple places in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and on <strong>multiple occasions for a period of at least 20 years and continues to this day</strong>,”. The judgment further states that, “Falun Gong practitioners in detention were systematically subjected to blood tests and organ examinations. Dr Trey, an (expert) witness raises the question ‘Why would detained Falun Gong practitioners receive specific physical examinations (including X-Ray, ultrasound and blood tests) while at the same time being subjected to brainwashing, labour work, torture or torture death?’ He postulates that the only rational explanation is to build up a systematic medical databank of potential living organ donors.” On the basis of all the evidence on the subject, the Tribunal concluded that the medical testing of Falun Gongs and Uyghurs was related in some way to the group concerned because other prisoners were not tested. No explanation has been given by the PRC for these testings yet.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Both the Red Cross Society of China and Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting also cast doubts in this regard as there had been a <a href="https://dafoh.org/wp-content/uploads/Registered-organ-donors-in-China-2015-2016.jpg">sudden increase</a> of more than 25,000 organ donors on a single day in December 2015 and&nbsp;88,300 registered organ donors&nbsp;within a six-day period in December 2016, a number that can only be explained by a large-scale, <strong>forced</strong> organ harvesting programme. Ethan Gutmann, a human rights investigator, testified to the <a href="https://chinatribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ChinaTribunal_-SummaryJudgment_17June2019.pdf">China Tribunal</a> that “over the last 18 months, literally every Uyghur man, woman, and child – about 15 million people – have been blood and DNA tested, and that blood testing is compatible with tissue matching”.</p>



<h3><strong>The Proponents and Opponents</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China&#8217;s critics&nbsp;are mainly in the western world and also include major democracies like Australia and Japan. All 27 are considered either full or flawed democracies according to the <a href="https://www.in.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Democracy-Index-2019.pdf">Democratic Index 2019</a> given by The Economist Intelligence Unit. China is backed by a conglomeration of authoritarian and hybrid countries, including many of the world&#8217;s most brutal dictatorships namely North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Unexpectedly, most of the signatories of the letter defending China&#8217;s new policy happened to be Muslim-majority nations like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, UAE and Syria. In the past, as the members of the Organization of Islamic Co-operation (OIC), they were not muted when Myanmar persecuted Rohingya Muslims and expelled 700,000 of them to Bangladesh. They were unequivocally releasing <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/oic-statement-on-us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israels-capital/">statements </a>in condemnation when the Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But they are almost hushed on China’s attempt to suppress Islam in Xinjiang.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Albeit, some other OIC members such as Afghanistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, and Turkey refrained from signing the statement in support of Beijing. Regardless, all Muslim majority countries have ignored the call by the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/10/un-unprecedented-joint-call-china-end-xinjiang-abuses">UNHRC </a>to examine the situation in Xinjiang. There are quite a few factors which may have led these countries to keep distance from criticizing China.</p>



<p>Some OIC members are part of the <strong>Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</strong> and thus have their economic future linked up with China. The political cost of impeding the Uyghur issue would be too high for any of these countries to endure. The success of the BRI depends on the Xinjiang region as it is the main route to the Arabian Sea via Pakistan. Any instability here can jeopardize Beijing&#8217;s plans for trade connectivity, risk its investments and disturb all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Beijing remains the Arab world&#8217;s long-term consumer base for the next few decades as fluctuating oil prices and the rise of western demand for alternate energy sources endanger its economic stability.</p>



<p>China is also expending loans and grants to these nations. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-arabstates/chinas-xi-pledges-20-billion-in-loans-to-revive-middle-east-idUSKBN1K0072">$20 billion</a> in loans to Arab countries, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/pakistan-owes-china-money-owes-imf-191003104027694.html#:~:text=Pakistan%20has%20been%20borrowing%20from%20Beijing%20to%20tide%20over%20a%20financial%20crisis.&amp;text=The%20South%20Asian%20nation%20owes,out%20Pakistan%20from%20a%20crisis.">$6.7 billion</a> to Pakistan, <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/english/business/kazakh-chinese-industrial-projects-exceed-27-billion/50000265-3523943">$27 billion</a> in projects in Kazakhstan and many other central Asian nations. China&#8217;s massive investments are bearing fruit. Beijing has effectively taken advantage of the UNHRC to endorse the very activities it was created to oppose.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">China is not only inflicting a cultural genocide of Uyghurs, but it is also repressing other cultural and religious minorities like Christians and Hui Muslims. It continues to abuse lawyers, human rights defenders, and activists. Any activity carried out in China to advocate for social change runs the risk of harassment by Chinese authorities. Basically, anything that the government considers as a threat to itself is a crime in its perspective. The worst violation of human rights is happening right in front of us. China is actively shifting the world narrative in its favour. Regardless of power, there are consequences for challenging China. Australia found itself in a trade dispute with its largest trading partner after pushing for international scrutiny into the origins of the novel-coronavirus. Two Canadian citizens are still being held in China after Canada arrested Huawei&#8217;s CFO on behalf of the United States. Nevertheless, China has been backlashed by the global community which grows its support for defending the human rights.</p>
