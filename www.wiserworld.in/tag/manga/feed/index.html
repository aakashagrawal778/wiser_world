										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about Japan is World War 2 and its devastating effects on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now after a long journey from those tragic days Japan has established itself as one of the world’s biggest and advanced countries along with a stable economy and high-end technology. There is another thing about Japan, which makes the country famous all over the world, generating a buzz-worthy status to its soft power, that soft power is named as <em>Anime</em>, as the name suggests, it<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-3338e426-1ed8-4ac3-b366-230b909aa0da"></mark> refers to animation.</p>



<p>Anime is the animation or cartoon particularly made in Japan with a huge fan following all over the world. &nbsp;This art form covers serious topics than usual cartoon animations, not only does it attract children but also young adults and teens. It is a huge concept covering different genres like comedy, romance, drama, pornography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the animes share the same kind of appearance which is different from the other cartoons and animations. The editors, the designers, the creators all strictly follow a peculiar artwork for anime. The characters have big eyes, highlighted bright colourful hairs, and chick dressing sense. They also have exaggerated emotional expressions and <a href="https://jw-webmagazine.com/best-anime/">gestures</a> which are specifically meant for the anime characters. Many of the characters are inspired by the characters of Disney like seven dwarfs, Micky mouse, mini mouse, and so on. So we really cannot confirm where the idea of big eyes, well- endowed figures have come from.</p>

<h2>The Anime Culture and Its Popularity</h2>



<p>The anime culture is purely Japanese. This culture was born in Japan along with the birth of <em>Otaku</em> subcultures in the 1960s. It has made a huge impact on its own country. The citizens and government of Japan constructed different kinds of statues, landmarks, and sites for the local citizens and also for the tourists. It is such a dominant side of Japan that many companies, business, brands, and organizations use anime characters in the advertisement, slogans, packaging, snacks and so on. Some brands have even launched anime-theme products for the customers, they are surprisingly doing very well in the markets of Japan as well as abroad. These markets are mainly the younger market, where audiences are more curious about the mascots or anime characters featuring in the product more than the product itself. It has become a household cultural trend among kids and young adults ever <a href="https://gogonihon.com/en/blog/a-small-glimpse-into-history-of-japanese-anime/">since </a>the nineties along with pokemon, Digimon, yu-gi-oh.</p>



<p>The inspiration for anime has partially come from Japanese comic books, <em>manga</em>. Japanese culture can be seen in many TV shows. High schools in Japan are as similar as shown in anime. Staying in traditional ryokan inns, eating with chopsticks, the same kind of accessories, quite the same kind of hair and dressing styles are seen in the common people of Japan. There is a character called Hatsune Miku, Japan&#8217;s first Vocaloid singer, who has a huge fan base and craze over the Japanese young audience. There are also many realistic shows of anime that accurately blend Japanese culture into art. A Japanese village Manoyama has an anime based on itself named Sakura Quest. The Ambition of Oda Nobuna is based on another real man of Japan’s history called Nobunaga.</p>



<p>A massive part of the Japanese cultural industry, their animation industry is the country&#8217;s third-largest industry, bringing nearly $20 billion a year. It is visible everywhere across the country. As we can tell that most of the Japanese people are a fan of anime, the country is filled with people who are mad about manga as wekk<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-43b08fd9-d191-41a1-9c2f-1a18b0fdf0f4"></mark> and are really into otaku culture.</p>



<h2>Anime’s World Domination</h2>



<p>The world of anime is full of the genre, variety, and a lot of complexity. It is an incredibly rich culture. It<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-3d37aa71-b371-4580-bc7e-57429601d96f"></mark> is not only famous in Asian countries but also has an expanding fanbase among Indians, Americans, Europeans, and many more. An amazing thing about the animation industry is that 60% of all animated shows across the world come from Japan. Marketed to a huge global audience, it has been growing higher and higher in terms of popularity, income, and fame. Apart from providing the biggest selling film in Japan, Korea, China, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, it has become the most likeable among the western countries.</p>



<p>When it comes to animation, Disney has always been the priority of many audiences. With the rising popularity of anime, Disney has decided to put a Pokemon theme park in Disneyland.</p>



<p>Astro-boy, Dragon Ball, Howl’s Moving Castle, Detective Conan, Cowboy Bebop are very famous and popular in the world. People try to make their anime characters inspired by the characters from these series. Many of the popular anime series and films are taken to be remade in different film industries in different languages. The fantasy world of anime is just taking over us all with lots of colours, moments, and sounds, and songs bring these cartoon characters to life. Shockingly this fantasy world of anime and its characters has more fan following and popularity than many real celebrities.</p>



<p>Anime and the USA has an old connection since the 60s, American <a href="https://jpninfo.com/31964">fandom </a>has always been loyal to the anime series since then. Channels like Cartoon Network and Sci-Fi programmed anime blocks, series, movies from the 90s. Anime has already taken over Netflix, Amazon Prime. Apart from these anime has a specific app for streaming named HULU. Social media has been a great platform to know about anime characters, their specialty. Halloween costumes, memes, sites like makegirlsmoe, cosplay community are just all about anime and its impact.</p>



<h2>The Soft Power of Japan: Anime</h2>



<p>The love of Japanese people is and perhaps always will be anime.  A lot of ceremonies are celebrated in Japan with the presence of an anime mascot and theme. Before the K-pop industry in South Korea became popular, anime was already there with its immense popularity, huge fanbases, and sky-high viewership. The multi-billion dollar industry is quite a strong tower in <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/case-study-of-the-japanese-economy/">Japan’s economy</a>. Japan’s contribution to the world in terms of cars, video games, fashion, and anime is quite impressive.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan has lots of brands, products specifically themed in anime for the market with the positive point of the blue ocean market. Well in the field of tourism anime has been a great plus point. Besides the reflection of Japanese culture, food, dressing style in anime already attract the tourist but different kinds of anime concert, anime-themed markets, mascot, statues, art camps are way more effective in promoting tourism to Japan as well as influencing pop-cultures. Places like Tokyo Anime Centre; holds daily radio with an anime character, the electric city Akihabara known as the otaku destination, J-talk Tokyo, Tokyo character street, Dogo onsen, Otome Road are hubs for tourists, people all over the world&#8217;s visits these places for their craving for anime, game worlds and many more. Tourism is becoming a high hit in Japan due to its influence all over the world.</p>

<p>Being the third biggest largest economy in the world, with the rising soft power, culture, and diplomatic relations, Japan is doing a great deal in enhancing its international standing. Japan has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190610-did-manga-shape-how-the-world-sees-japan">invested </a>billions of dollars in cultural exchange and teaching of the Japanese language, which is a great success to date and giving a major boost to the economy of the country. A lot of the young generation coming to Japan in search of work, education, and to learn the otaku culture is a great deal for its economy and culture. The root of anime all across the world becoming a major soft power bouncer to the country. The Japanese government has exploited the power of its animation industry to make the country’s economy stronger. The Japanese government has made a lot of investment to make anime-themed towns and museums for tourist attractions. This not only helps the tourism, or work section but also brings a lot’s of business collaboration from the world. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rise of Japanese programs is also helping japan to promote their pop-culture in quite an impressive way. The formation and promotion of J-pop just like K-pop is one such example. It’s kind of popular among the younger generation.</p>



<p>“Art and culture play a vital role in globalization. It is a way to get your message across, an effective yet discreet way to create friends – opposite to the alarm and fear resulting from coercion.’’ <a href="https://www2.palomar.edu/impactmagazine/2018/06/28/anime-more-than-asian-pop-culture/">said </a>the commissioner at the Japanese government’s cultural agency, Seiichi Kundu.<br>‘’Japanese pop culture is a gateway to the deeper and more traditional Japanese culture’’ <a href="https://www.globalasia.org/v6no1/feature/cool-japan-soft-power_asger-r%C3%B8jle-christensen">said</a>, Ambassador Kondo.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Anime has become the soft power to Japan indeed. The paradox is that the concept of japan’s soft power is not very controversial. People back in Japan and abroad discussed it as a soft power very little. Not like other soft powers, it is not offensive, it is loved by all. It is creating a new pride and confidence in confronting the issue of soft power to the world. Anime’s emphasis on cultural diplomacy is quite agreeable to the whole world. The tourism market, education sector, learning camps are rising daily as lots of people across the globe are getting attracted towards Japan. The people who are still at home trying to learn Japanese, buying many anime-themed products, kind of being prepared for their first visit to Japan, helps the Japanese government to gain more revenues hence improving their economy.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Japan, an island country situated in East Asia, is known worldwide for its remarkable Japanese culture, which is perhaps one of the most unique and vibrant cultures to have ever prospered in the world. Often called the <strong>Land of the Rising Sun</strong>, the country is heavily associated with cherry blossom trees (Sakura), anime and manga, Sushi and Ramen, tea ceremonies, etc, pictures of which are often displayed in Japan tourism ads.</p>



<h3><strong>KYOTO – THE CULTURAL CENTRE</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While the rich culture of Japan is prevalent throughout the entire nation, the city of Kyoto in the southwest of the country is regarded as the cultural centre, by the Japanese and foreigners alike, perhaps owing to its historical roots. Kyoto was the capital of the country until the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and therefore people often perceive it as the birthplace of the Japanese culture. Home to about 2000 temples and shrines along with imperial palaces, and other ancient buildings, it was within this city that several distinct cultural institutions of Japan, like, <strong>tea ceremony (cha-no-yu)</strong> and <strong>flower</strong> <strong>arranging (ikebana)</strong>,<strong> the theatrical arts of Noh</strong>,<strong> Kabuki </strong>and <strong>traditional dance</strong>, were initiated and spread to other parts of the country. Kyoto also has housed masterpieces of calligraphy, sculpting, painting and architecture. The population in Kyoto still remains involved in such activities, creating masterpieces that are deemed as national treasures, conducting tea ceremonies, and having an active theatrical life with annual processions by Noh performers, etc. The three festivals that the citizens celebrate in great grandeur and pride are <strong>Aoi </strong>in May, <strong>Gion</strong> in July and <strong>Jidai</strong> in October.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Japanese population along with the whole world, has embraced the culture of Kyoto, which can be implied by the recent popularity of the phrase, <strong>“Sekai no Kyoto”</strong> (The World’s Kyoto). The popular tourist destinations like the many number of Shrines and temples (Fushimi Inari Shrine, Gingaku – Ji Temple, Kinkaku – Ji temple, etc ), the Arashiyama Bamboo grove, and others such as Gion and Pont-cho street attract tourists from all over the world, and even the native Japanese who try to go to the city atleast once in their lives.</p>



<h3><strong>RELIGION – Buddhism and Shintoism</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Japan has seen the growth of two major religions, i.e, Buddhism which was brought about by foreign forces and the native religion of Shintoism, both of which have peacefully co-existed. However, the &nbsp;division between followers of Buddhism and Shintoism is far from watertight, as most often, those Japanese who follow Buddhism, sometimes also declare themselves as followers of Shinto. Therefore, any claims of the population being divided solely into Buddhists and Shintos do not hold.</p>



<h4><strong>Shintoism</strong></h4>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Shinto, i.e, the way of the Gods (Kami) is the oldest religion in Japan and possibly the most followed, as evidence suggests that about 80% of the Japanese identify themselves as followers of Shinto. There are no historical evidences that suggest the identity of the founder of the religion, and a lack of sacred texts and any sort of formalized teachings, indicate the fact that unlike Buddhism, it’s not an organized religion. The cornerstone of Shintoism is the belief in <a href="https://thetruejapan.com/shinto-a-look-into-the-religion-of-japan/">Kami</a>, i.e, the spiritual elements of nature that exist in waterways, trees, mountains, and geographical regions. &nbsp;The only foundation of the religion in conclusion is therefore, reverence of peace and harmony, respect for all elements of nature and the belief that being in nature means a closer access to Kami.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:12px"><em>The Great Buddha (Daibutsu) at Kōtoku-in, Kamakura, in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan</em></p>



<p>Buddhism which officially came to Japan around 525 BC, has been able to acquire a large following in the country, with about 90 million of the population identifying themselves as Buddhists. While the religion faced a certain conflict between pro-Buddhist and anti-Buddhism factions, it was successful in establishing its foundations in Japan and subsequently changed the political structure, technological fields and brought in a myriad of sophisticated cultural practices like dance, music, a new writing system and also Buddhist art, that have undoubtedly had a greater impact on the Japanese culture as a whole.</p>



<h3><strong>‘<em>Matsuri</em>’ – THE CULTURAL FESTIVALS OF JAPAN</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A very important and lively aspect of Japanese culture, is the many number of ‘<strong>matsuri’</strong> or the cultural festivals, which bring in cheerful spirits for the native population, who often enjoy the festivities wearing colourful and mostly, traditional clothes and getting involved in the activities the festivals are known for. Research suggests that Japan witnesses as many as 200-300 festivals in a year, all of which are big, fun and crowded events, and are deeply entrenched within the Japanese Culture.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These festivals which occur over the course of a year, differ greatly in terms of the season in which they occur.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>SUMMER</strong>: The festivals in summer are known worldwide for their use of fireworks or what the Japanese call, <strong>Hanabi</strong>. These fireworks light up the sky in bright colours and the people often dressed in their Yukatas and Kimonos,&nbsp; gather in large numbers to watch the show.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>SPRING</strong>: In Spring, the Cherry blossoms or Sakura trees turn pink which in itself is a site of majestic beauty. The spring festivals are centered around these trees, where people from different regions come and enjoy activities under the cherry blossoms either in a park, a castle, etc. The <strong>Hirosaki Cherry Blossom</strong> <strong>Festival</strong> is perhaps one of the most famous of such festivals that are conducted in Japan.</p>

<h3><strong>What role have ANIME and MANGA played in Japanese culture? &nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Anime</strong>, as the name suggests, is Japanese animation which is either hand-drawn or computer-animated. The diverse fan base of Anime, which is worldwide,is perhaps because of it’s very distinct characteristics that distinguish it from animation produced in any other parts of the world. <strong>Manga</strong>, on the other hand, are more like Japanese comics or Graphic novels which are read from right to left, while western comics can only be read left to right. Often, those mangas which are able to acquire a large fan base, like Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Haikyu, etc, are converted into anime. Both Anime and Manga, over the years have become a very crucial aspect of Japanese culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <strong>unconventionality </strong>associated with anime and manga, is perhaps a contributor to it’s popularity among adults, and not just kids. These stories that are available in all genres like action, romance, slice of life, rom-com, supernatural, horror, etc, break the notion that anime is meant only for kids. The fan base remain hooked on each episode or chapter, due to the unpredictability of what might happen next.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In Japan, anime and Manga, has become a way of life for <strong>‘Otakus’</strong> (which however is an offensive word for the Japanese) a term used for those hardcore fans of these elements, to the extent that they give up their social lives and withdraw into their homes watching anime and playing video games. The emotional attachment to these forms of entertainment becomes evident when numerous instances of funerals held for anime characters come into light. But anime in Japan is not only limited to the private sphere. It’s presence is abundant everywhere, on trains, buses, advertisements, etc. Moreover, anime and manga also provide a deep insight into Japanese culture, in both covert and overt ways. Most animes have episodes dedicated to the cultural festivals, fireworks, cherry blossoms, otaku culture, Japanese way of living, tea ceremonies and so on. The town of <strong>Akihabara</strong> near Tokyo, is believed to be the Anime centre, the streets of which are lined with numerous anime shops selling anime merchandise of various kinds. There are also many themed cafes like maid and butler cafes, which attract a lot of tourists. Even outside Akihabara, it is not uncommon to find many huge or life-size statues that give tribute to anime characters and their creators. Anime themed parks, which are a sight of awe for tourists as well as the natives are also abundant in Japan, the most famous of them being the Naruto theme park, Attack on Titans theme park, etc. Often, streets of Japan are also lined with cosplayers, impersonating characters from famous animes. In fact, cosplaying is also an important part of Japanese culture, which has immense importance, as evident by the numerous cosplay competitions held throughout the nation. Anime conventions are also likely events in Japan which are attended by Anime fans from Japan and all over the world.</p>



<h3><strong>TRADITIONAL ARCHITECTURE, CUISINE AND ATTIRE</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Traditional Japanese Architecture is attributed to a distinct aesthetic, that can be attributed to some unique characteristics used in the making of these homes. The dominant feature of traditional Japanese homes is <strong>wood</strong>, that is preferred in the making of the house over other materials such as stone, perhaps owing to the unpredictability brought about by earthquakes. Wood is respected by the Japanese to the extent that the wood in homes remain in their natural forms and is not concealed by paint. The doors in these houses are fusuma, or sliding doors while the windows are movable screens (shoji). The floors in Japanese houses are covered with tatami mats, made with straw, that along with the wood provides a distinct smell to the traditional Japanese houses. Outside the houses, are what may be called verandahs, which are a wooden extension to the house, which are often elevated from the ground, sometimes covered with shutters.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Japanese cuisine basically comprises of regional and traditional foods, and primarily focuses on combining <strong>steamed rice (gohan</strong>) which is their staple with one or more main and side dishes and <strong>miso soup </strong>or pickles. While this typically describes the traditional meal, there are also many other variants of food that the Japanese are known for like, <strong>Sushi, Ramen, tempura, Curry rice, Yakitori</strong>, etc.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:12px"></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India and Japan have continued to maintain strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Japan_relations#Cultural">cultural ties</a>, ever since the arrival of Buddhism in Japan, from India. The countries have often engaged in mutual cultural exchanges and also follow some similar cultural traditions and ideas along with Buddhism, like the commitment to Democracy, pluralism, open societies, tolerance, etc. The <strong><a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/events/namaste-india/">Namaste India Festival</a></strong> which is held in Tokyo every year is aimed at realizing the agreement between the two countries about holding cultural festivals, on 2007, which marked the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Indo-Japan cultural agreement. These festivals aim at bringing an insight of each country’s culture, that includes food, music, souvenirs, clothes, etc, to the other.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The above quote by Hector Garcia, in &nbsp;‘Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life’ therefore sums up the very dynamic and cheerful&nbsp; Japanese culture, which has fascinated many souls over the years. Therefore, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Japanese culture which comes to life in it’s cultural festivals, anime, cuisine, architecture, an unbreakable link with nature and various other quirky things that people associate with Japan have been able to become an object of awe and interest for people all over the world.</p>
