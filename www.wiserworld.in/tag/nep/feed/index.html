<p class="has-drop-cap">Since the first week of December 2020, we noticed Mrs Bector’s Food Specialities or Mrs Bector&#8217;s Cremica making its way to the headlines. They announced share allotment to the public and got a whopping response by becoming the most subscribed IPO this year.<br><br><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/ipo#:~:text=Definition%3A%20Initial%20public%20offering%20is,its%20stocks%20to%20general%20public.&amp;text=The%20company%20which%20offers%20its,traded%20in%20an%20open%20market." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Initial Public Offering</a>&nbsp;(IPO) is the process in which a private company sells its stocks to the general public. It could be a budding, young company or a well-established old company which decides to be listed on the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/indian-stock-market-bubble-2020/">stock exchange</a>. With the help of an IPO, companies raise equity capital by issuing new shares to the public or the existing big shareholders can sell their shares to the public without raising any fresh capital.</p>



<p>Mrs Bector’s Food Specialities IPO or Mrs Bector&#8217;s Cremica <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/mrs-bectors-food-specialities-ipo-allotment-status-how-to-check-share-allotment-status-online-7113277/">offered&nbsp;</a>1.32 crore shares and got oversubscribed very soon witnessing a massive 198.02 times subscription. The window offered to the general public was from 15-17 December 2020. In fact, the craze over their IPO knew no bounds as bids reached over 262.10 crores against the total issue size of 1.32 crore according to the National Stock Exchange. This brand has existed since my childhood days and it made me question how it all came into existence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Family History</strong> of Mrs Bector&#8217;s Cremica</h2>

<h3><strong>Before 1990</strong></h3>



<p>Before one gets confused it needs to be clarified that biscuits and sauces are sold under the brand name “Mrs Bector’s” and bakery products are sold under the name “English Oven”. The founder and creator of this large a company is Mrs Rajni Bector who was born in the city of Karachi but shifted to Ludhiana in Punjab during the 1947 partition. Brought up in the same city and got married at the age of 17, she raised three sons and sent them off to boarding school in Mussoorie. After this, it dawned upon her that all the free time she had could be utilized well and more productively by enhancing her culinary skills. She was very passionate about food and to take it a notch higher she enrolled herself into a course offered by Punjab Agricultural University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During 1978, almost 42 years back when women were suppressed by society and looked down upon for stepping into the business sector, Mrs Bector decided to start a small venture in her backyard. Just like any home-cooked food startup, hers relied on word of mouth for the news to spread and soon started receiving orders not just from her friends and family but also from her neighbours with regard to cooking for parties and social gatherings and built a network of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A startup aims for something higher every day but it was disheartening for the entire family to see their efforts not yielding desirable profits. There was no sign of growth whatsoever and the investments weren’t helping. Dharamvir, Rajni’s husband, took a call of putting all their eggs in one basket and moving ahead with investing big, expanding and commercializing the initiative. With their first bulk investment of Rs.20,000 for the budding company in 1978, Mrs Bector decided to set up a compact ice-cream manufacturing unit in the same backyard to cater to bulk orders.</p>



<p>The 1990s also saw terrorism as a bad phase and the Bector’s ancestral business in Punjab got highly affected for the first time in 107 years of its existence. They decided to not let this setback affect them in any way as Cremica Group had already started making booming profits and was a well-known business worth 5 crores.</p>



<h3><strong>1990s LPG</strong> (Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation)</h3>



<p>On July 24 1991, India announced its New Economic Policy (NEP) and named it&nbsp;<a href="https://journalsofindia.com/lpg-reforms-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LPG<strong>&nbsp;</strong></a>or Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation model. The main objective was to achieve economic stability through plunging into “Globalization” and to give the economy a new thrust on market orientation. The process of globalization, therefore, was accompanied by a strong dose of Americanization manifest as India opened its arms to big private companies in such symbols as Coca-Cola and McDonalds and spread their influence all over the world.</p>



<p>McDonald&#8217;s India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of McDonald&#8217;s India Private Limited (MIPL) was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280875209_McDonaldization_in_India">incorporated </a>in 1993. From the term McDonald&#8217;s,&nbsp;McDonaldization&nbsp;as a concept was derived and can be applied and studied in Indian society. This term was first used by sociologist George Ritzer in his book “The McDonaldization of Society”. He goes on to explain that it is the occurrence of homogenization of cultures when a culture possesses the characteristics of a fast-food restaurant.&nbsp;Right before India transitioned into the McDonaldization phase, Mr Akshay Bector came to know that McDonald&#8217;s was scouting for local suppliers and therefore wrote a letter directly to their head office expressing his interest to be a part of this venture.</p>



<p>To their surprise the company zeroed down to Cremica for the supply of buns and the partnership was later expanded to liquid condiments, buns and other bakery products as well, this in itself was a huge turning point for the entire family in 1995. They also entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Quaker Oats in 1996, a USA based company, and launched a new brand by the name Quaker Cremica Foods (P) Ltd. They mainly looked after liquid products such as, Mayonnaise, Tomato Ketchup, Milkshake Syrups, Tartar &amp; Sandwich Spreads, and Ice Cream topping which would mainly cater to McDonald’s requirement in India and its neighbouring countries. Mrs Bector also supplied to Burger King.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Demerger</strong> of Mrs Bector&#8217;s Cremica</h2>



<p>In 2013 there was a paradigm shift and the entire business was divided into three equal parts between Rajni Bector’s sons. An agreement was made between Ajay, Anoop and Akshay where biscuits and bakery business was demerged from the condiments business. Post demerger Akshay Bector decided to go national in retail space by planning an IPO. As a part of the entire settlement process, the PE Firm Motilal Oswal which is known to currently possess a 20% stake in the company will now have a stake in the biscuit business only. Mrs Bector’s also planned to focus more on retailing with time and put more emphasis on the premium segment of the market.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Mrs Bector started her venture in the small backyard of hers by herself when the society was busy harbouring toxic traits of its ancestors, holding women back in whichever way possible, not letting them reach the top. Mrs Bector&#8217;s Cremica soon grew into a full-fledged family run corporation bringing joy and pride to the entire country. However, with success and achievements came greater strategic issues leading into a demerger. In my opinion, demerger intertwined with the introduction of IPO and the road ahead seems very exciting but at the same time, it’s a rollercoaster ride. The family is bound to face a new set of highs and lows individually and we can only take a backseat and watch them tackle hurdles, grow and expand to the best of their potential.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Education gives us the manpower to achieve anything and everything around us. It is fundamental for achieving complete human potential and creates a tank full of opportunities for everyone. The New Education Policy will demise the structure of old learning and give rise to an innovative and comprehensive approach. It sets out a vision for 2040.</p>



<h3><strong>Evolution</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The previous policies have focused largely on equality of education and accessibility. The first Education policy came in 1968 and the second in 1986 which was revised in 1992 and the third one is The Education Policy under the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/the-three-consequential-acts-of-the-first-year-of-modi-2-0/">BJP Government</a>. The cabinet approved the New Education Policy on July 29<sup>th</sup>, after a 34-year gap. The other major development since the 1986/92 policy has been the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Act 2009 which laid down legal underpinnings for achieving universal elementary education. The implementation of the policy will further depend on both State and Centre as education is a concurrent subject. The global education development agenda reflected in the Goal 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by India in 2015 &#8211; seeks to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. The major aim of the education policy is to make “India global knowledge of superpower”.<sup>[i]</sup> The world is undergoing rapid changes in various technological, scientific and research advancement. The new policy extensively focuses on these major changes in the system of rote learning.</p>



<h3><strong>A BRIEF</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The New Education Policy has been a mammoth task. Two committees undertook the policy various feedback was taken and widely consulted. The policy document was examined several times before being sent for approval. The new document is radically different from all its predecessors as it outlines a completely new framework for our education. Good education policy is where wide learning is offered with good infrastructure and appropriate resources are provided. The key points which the policy emphasis on are:</p>



<ul><li>Recognising and fostering every individual’s capabilities and sensitizing teachers and parents as well to promote students in holistic development.</li><li>One of the essential fundamentals which have been left unaddressed until now is Early Childhood Care and Education. The policy says, over 85% of a child’s brain development occurs prior to the age 8. Thus, it focuses on achieving Foundational Literacy and Numeracy for all students by grade 3<sup>rd</sup>.</li><li>Flexibility for learners to choose their learning projectors and choose their life paths according to their talent. Furthermore, there will be no hard separation between the streams. This also promotes the dispel of various notions of society and hierarchies.</li><li>Multidisciplinary approach in order to promote uniformity and integrity for all knowledge. Emphasis on conceptual understanding and critical thinking.</li><li>The vocational programs from school education. The policy has reconceptualised practical learning and give it a heads up. Which focuses on giving students an opportunity to intern at school level and learn a programming language.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The fundamental keynotes ensure integrity, transparency and empowerment of all students.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Vision of the Policy</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>School Learning</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The policy envisages that the 10+2 old schooling structure will be modified with a 5+3+3+4 which will cover the age group of 3-6 and brings early childhood education. It constitutes the foundational stage of education. The restructure has been proposed keeping in mind the holistic development of the children. As the policy focuses on &#8216;the overarching goal would be to ensure universal access to high-quality ECCE across the country. It facilities amalgamation project led ecosystem of education which focuses on process and not just an outcome. It shifts the focus from conventional learning practices of delivering assignments. The Boards are redesigned now students can appear for it twice one for main examination and other for improvement if they desired. NEP 2020 also proposes a shift from summative assessments to regular and formative assessments. Which will focus on analysis, critical thinking and conceptual clarity? The government also focuses on multilingualism and suggests that students until class 5 should be taught in their mother tongue or regional language. This received a mixed reaction some says it will promote multilingualism while others comment it as a downfall for rural-urban students who wish to learn English.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The introduction to vocational studies grades 6 onwards and creation of National Committee for the Integration of Vocational Education (NCIVE) is an extremely important decision to remove the societal stigma attached with taking vocation as a career. Lastly one of the major problematic situations for every student has been choosing the streams, one of the critical factors of the new policy is flexibility. The dismantling of the rigid distinction of academics gives students much more flexibility and freedom to choose subjects of their interest and desires. Thus, it focuses on universalising education from early childhood.</p>



<h4><strong>Higher Education</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/nep-2020-new-education-policy-to-revamp-the-education-system-of-21st-century-1711501-2020-08-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makers </a>of this policy, some of the salient problems in the higher education institutions in our country is lack of research, limited teachers, less multidisciplinary courses and poor institutional governance.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Recognising the problems the policymakers came up with various new key ingredients. The decision to break the wall of streams and bring in flexibility, provisions of freedom to exit and entre courses, credit-based system and introduction to a 4-year degree with research.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The document also states universities among the world top 100 will be able to set up in India. However, this will only process ones the HRD Ministry brings a new law that includes the details of how foreign universities will operate. We can also see a partnership between government and private educational programmes which will result in the fruitful outcome and a shift into the latest technologies. Among the several new features of NEP 2020, one of the best is granting more autonomy to educational institutions which are providing quality education. The other is a single regulator for higher education. The other significant reform is the provision of multiple entries and exits points. This will help students to pursue the course of their choice at their own pace and without getting affected by the impact of their personal circumstances. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It also eliminates the MPhil programme which does not affect higher education trajectory at all. But it also emphasis equally on research and offers a 4-year undergraduate degree. As research is the foundation of knowledge creation and it plays a crucial role in the upliftment of any human. The policy envisages the creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF). Its main objective will be to provide areas of themes for research and coordination and build a platform for budding researchers which the nation strives for the next coming decade. However, the biggest challenge for the government would be to reduce the digital disparity which exists among students as well as teachers. Additionally, we also need to focus upon the skill development and training of educators and teachers who will help the nation in the rebuilding project.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These are some of the pathbreaking provisions which NEP 2020 focuses on. It opens the door for hopes and aspirations. It is visionary and transformational however, the success lies in its implementation.</p>
