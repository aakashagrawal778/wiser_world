<h2><strong>The Concept of ‘Being Happy’ in India&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>India, spanning across 29 states and 8 union territories, offers unique ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. While taking a stroll in the streets of India, one can see people doing their daily stuff, whatever that is. Or they are just standing and sitting around talking in a large group of people. Whatever they are engaged in, one thing is universal. They seem to be relaxed in whatever they do and be at peace with themselves and the environment. It is as if they don&#8217;t need the word ‘happy’ in their vocabulary to feel good and relaxed: they are fine with how it is. In India, happiness is not an abstract term. that people all intend to have as their life’s goal.</p>



<p>Maybe the Indian version of happiness has something to do with the present activities. Maybe being happy is just equivalent to being yourself. It&#8217;s more about not wishing for anything else and not to have big desires for which we would be willing to give something dear but to find these desires and happiness in the things we already have and as a result be grateful and at peace. Maybe it is acceptance of what is instead of hoping for what may be.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Happiness, Well-being and Human Development</strong> </h2>



<p>It is quite understandable that the ultimate objective of social and economic development is to provide improvements in the lives of men and women who generate employment now and the younger generation who we hope will generate in the future. This makes the idea of well-being universal: achieving a state of well-being has to be inclusive everywhere, whether in developed or developing countries (OECD, 2015).</p>



<p>Well-being is a focal concept: human well-being provides a means of understanding the growing relationships between apparently diverse ideas and issues that abound as and often appear to compete, in the international agendas. The proper study of human well-being provides a possible way to map out the relationship between poverty and sustainability as it helps us to explore the relationship between various economic dimensions and development such as productivity and efficiency, social cohesion and governance which are vital for the successful overall development (OECD, 2015).</p>



<p>Following the need to study the relevance of happiness, well-being and human development, various methodologies were developed in the international conferences and meetings of the United Nations (UN), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These methodologies presented frameworks that incorporated the socio-economic indicators which can be used to assess the improvements in human well-being. One of the innovations suggested by the well-being approach saw human well-being as a holistic phenomenon. The framework which was put forward by OECD was known as ‘How is Life’ framework. This provides a good example of this multidimensional approach to measuring human well-being that can be used to discuss its relevance for developing countries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="405" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min.png" alt="‘How is Life’ Framework" class="wp-image-4343" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min.png 602w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-min-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><figcaption>‘How is Life’ Framework | Source: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/site/oecdgfd/Session%203.1%20-%20GFD%20Background%20Paper.pdf">OECD</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The above figure depicts the process of the OECDs ‘How is Life’ framework which involves three categories of variables. These three categories are listed below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Material Conditions</li><li>Quality of Life</li><li>Sustainability&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Within each of these three categories, there are a certain set of variables upon which data is assembled. Under ‘Material Conditions’ following three variables are listed:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Income and wealth</li><li>Jobs and earnings</li><li>Housing&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The variables included in the category ‘Quality of Life’ are listed below:</p>



<ul><li>Health status</li><li>Work and life balance</li><li>Education and skills</li><li>Social connections</li><li>Civic engagement and governance</li><li>Environmental quality</li><li>Personal security</li><li>Subjective well-being</li></ul>



<p>In the last ‘Sustainability’ category there are four types of capitals which are identified as being significant for the process that produces both material well-being and quality of life outcomes. These are listed below:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Natural capital</li><li>Economic capital</li><li>Human capital</li><li>Social capita</li></ul>



<p>Thus the major innovation will lie in the integrated adoption of a multidimensional approach to understanding progress which integrally considers people’s subjective evaluation of their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Subjective Well-being as an Alternate Tool for Policy Evaluation</strong></h2>



<p>In recent times, subjective wellbeing measures have established themselves as reliable alternatives to standard economic indicators of welfare. Intertest in subjective metrics have been largely driven by the growing dissatisfaction with the conventional use of objective indicators like GDP to evaluate the impact of economic activities on public and private sector decision making. This has led international organisations such as the UN and OECD to advise against using the GDP as a measure of economic progress as it does not capture the outcomes that matter to the well-being of the people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the governments in places like New Zealand, Wales, Iceland and Scotland have advocated and justified the use of subjective well-being matrices in evaluating public policy. As a result of which these countries have recently established the Wellbeing Economy Governments Alliance (WEGO) that aims to promote and share their expertise and transferable policy practices in regard to subjective well-being (Wiking, 2020).</p>



<p>The core benefit of using subjective well-being is that it measures individual experience by directly asking people to report how they feel about their lives. This is in contrast to the conventional economic metrics like inflation rate, unemployment rate and GDP per capita that focus instead on people’s market behaviour. The measures of subjective well-being have proven to be reliable across varying contexts. They remain stable over time, correlate with the third party, associate with physiological makers, respond to life changes and even help in predicting future socio-economic behaviour of individuals including suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is observed that the United Nations for the last eight years has published national rankings of subjective wellbeing in their World Happiness Report. These well-being measures have proven to be aligned with economic objective country conditions, including GDP per capita, life expectancy and levels of corruption. Subjective wellbeing metrics are therefore poised to reveal important underlying dynamics that can help us to understand how people have felt and behaved during the COVID-19 pandemic (Wiking, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Lessons Learnt From Nordic Countries</strong></h2>



<p>From 2013 till today, every time the World Happiness Report (WHR) has published its annual ranking of countries, the five Nordic countries- Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland have all been placed in the top ten with Nordic countries occupying the top three spots in 2017, 2018 and 2019. It is of no doubt that whether we look at the state of democracy, structure of political institutions, lack of corruption, social cohesion, trust between the citizens, gender equality or Human Development Index, one can easily find the Nordic countries in the global top spots (Martela &amp; Greve, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has been a lot of research done on finding the reasons that make Nordic citizens so exceptionally satisfied with their lives. Through reviewing the existing literature the prominent factors responsible for the happiness of Nordic citizens include quality of institutions, low corruption and proper well-functioning of democracy and political institutions. In addition, Nordic citizens experience a high sense of freedom as well as high levels of social trust among each other that play a significant role in determining life satisfaction (Martela &amp; Greve, 2020).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denmark is one of the top five happiest nations in the world. It has consistently remained in the top three global spots in the World Happiness Report. Comparing the Indian and Danish GDP, the GDP growth rate of Denmark averaged 0.40% from 1991 to 2018 while the annual growth rate of India’s GDP averaged at 6.61% from 1951 to 2018 (Trading Economics, 2019). Indian economy is much larger as compared to Danish economy. However, there are other factors than financial prosperity and GDP that makes the Danish people among the top happiest in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If India has to go the Nordic way, it can adopt some features of the happy country as mentioned in Figure 2. It clearly depicts that Denmark does simple things elegantly and makes it the motto of their life. They seek happiness in the small happening of their life and build a hyggelig environment around themselves (Sarkar, 2018).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Weaving the Path for India to Follow the Nordic Happiness Way: A Long Way Ahead</strong></h2>



<p>The happiness of the citizens in India needs to follow a six-pronged strategy to go the Nordic way of living and can be counted as a happy nation in near future. This strategy is depicted in the figure below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min.png" alt="happiness in india" class="wp-image-4344" width="562" height="492" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min.png 602w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-min-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /><figcaption>Six Pronged Strategy for India to Go the Nordic Way | <em>Source: Author’s own compilation</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Indian policymakers should carefully observe how education, transport, health and social policies will affect the happiness of citizens. Furthermore, policies that aim to promote public cooperation and equality are equally likely helpful in increasing the subjective indicators of well-being like longevity. India has been a place for poverty research for a very long period of time. With the appropriate policies in place, maybe it could become a laboratory to study happiness one day.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the start of the 21st century, it has been observed that national governments across the world have been investing in global news media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is that today we have Al Jazeera English, Telesur and China Global Television Network (CGTN). AJE is funded by the Emir of Qatar, Telesur by Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and several other Latin American governments and CGTN is owned by the Communist Chinese government. Even though these media outlets are state-run, they do not merely function as government mouthpieces. Their editorial policies vary according to essentially where they are located. But a common theme amongst three media outlets is that they aim to offer something different than the BBC and CNN, their reasons for the same vary though.</p>



<h3><strong>Telesur Editorial Policy</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TeleSUR.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2198" width="206" height="206" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TeleSUR.jpg 400w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TeleSUR-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TeleSUR-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" /><figcaption><em>Soruce: <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/">teleSUR</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Telesur is based in Caracas and it was launched as a 24/7 in October 2005. It’s stated editorial policy is to offer a different vision of news from the BBC or the CNN. The reason for this is that Telesur believes that these big media outlets for the longest time did not present their side of the story, it was always one-sided and against them. Never did the likes of CNN bothered to cover the local news of Latin American countries. CNN and the likes always seemed to pass America’s foreign policy goals. Telesur policy has been to challenge/critique American imperialism. A simple <a href="https://youtu.be/pDF0DvfzFSw">youtube</a> search result shows the numerous programmes done by Telesur on US imperialism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telesur not only gives an in-depth perspective of the Latin American people but it also to some extent focuses on raising the issues from the Global South. For eg., they did a <a href="https://youtu.be/nEFgxz58Sto">story</a> on the Indian Army&#8217;s Brutality in Kashmir. Telesur took a pro-people stand and an anti-establishment view.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Al Jazeera Editorial Policy</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Al_Jazeera_Media_Network_Logo.svg-min-1-1024x591.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2200" width="341" height="197" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Al_Jazeera_Media_Network_Logo.svg-min-1-1024x591.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Al_Jazeera_Media_Network_Logo.svg-min-1-300x173.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Al_Jazeera_Media_Network_Logo.svg-min-1-768x443.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Al_Jazeera_Media_Network_Logo.svg-min-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">AlJazeera</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>AJE was launched in November 2006, although there was already AJA (Arabic). The reason to launch an English version was to reach a global audience and present the views of the Arab/Muslim world. After the 9/11 attacks, the coverage of the <a href="https://careers.aljazeera.net/about-us/">Middle Eastern</a> countries by the likes of the BBC and CNN had created a negative stereotype about the Arab world. The one-sided coverage of the Iraq war by BBC world and CNN only played a spoilsport in strengthening the stereotype against the Arab population. AJE’s editorial policy, therefore, has been to present both sides of the story. Their aim is to provide a different perspective on the news. </p>



<p>According to Josh Rushing (AJ’s US Defence and Military Correspondent), “I tell people that Al-Jazeera provides a different perspective to CNN but an equally important one. CNN films the launch of a missile, AJ films what happens when it lands”. AJ provide different perspectives in three ways, firstly by covering the same international news in an alternate way to the ‘Western perspective’ of the BBC World and CNN, secondly, they cover the parts of the world which no one covers, which tends not to get reported at all and thirdly by covering the developing countries (Global South) in an original way. So their editorial policy is pretty much like Telesur when it comes to presenting a different world view about the Arab world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>China’s Global Television Network’s Editorial Policy</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CGTN-LOGO-GOLD-min-1-1024x277.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2202" width="392" height="106" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CGTN-LOGO-GOLD-min-1-1024x277.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CGTN-LOGO-GOLD-min-1-300x81.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CGTN-LOGO-GOLD-min-1-768x208.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CGTN-LOGO-GOLD-min-1.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.cgtn.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CGTN</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>CGTN, the <a href="https://www.cgtn.com/">Chinese</a> media outlet has a different editorial policy than Telesur and AJE. Since it’s controlled by the government, it mostly acts as an extended arm of the government. CGTN’s policy has been to show the better side of China to the world and debunk many stereotypes that the Western world has of China. China is always perceived with a negative perception in the Western world (America, EU countries etc) because of their being a Communist government and how there’s no press freedom at all. The recent reports of curbing dissent and protests and violation of Human Rights has also led many to have a very bad image of China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese government’s aim, therefore, is to change this perception and they use CGTN as their foreign policy arm. CGTN, therefore, channels the interests of the government in a more direct way. CGTN is trying to accomplish certain goals through its editorial policy, firstly it does shows on emphasising on History, culture, Philosophy and civilization of China, secondly, through its programmes it tries to assert that China is emerging as a formidable economic power (eg., their coverage of the celebration of ten years of Beijing Olympics) and lastly it wants to address certain stereotypes about China. So it’s quite evident that the Chinese government wants to change its global image with the help of CGTN. China wants the world to like it and increase its soft power through CGTN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As discussed above, China wants the world to like it and it cannot happen unless positive aspects of China are shown to the world. China&#8217;s growing military power, its political system along with its growing human rights violations, and it&#8217;s economic strength all contribute to its negative image abroad. For this reason, the Chinese government felt the need to invest in global media. The other reason to go global was that the government was not happy with the way they have been covered by the Western media in the past. Hence China invested more in strengthening it’s foreign language channels and expanded its partnership with foreign television organizations. Leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics the Western media had increased its coverage of China in a more hostile way, highlighting the Chinese government’s Human Rights violation records. The Western media’s coverage of the pro-Tibetan riots was seen by the Chinese government to be as anti-Chinese.</p>



<p> A <a href="https://youtu.be/F37l6lQqfUM">CBN</a>&nbsp; report highlighted the lack of democracy in China (no free journalism and suppression of dissent). It was believed that this would change after the games as post the <a href="http://www.cctr.ust.hk/materials/conference/workshop/14/nizp_olympics.pdf">Olympics</a> China was seen to have graduated as ‘World Power’. But nothing changed and the negative coverage of China by the Western media continued. Hence China could not wait for the Western media to change its critical stance on China and therefore it was needed that China is proactive and “go global” and push for Chinese perspectives into the international arena if it wanted to contest the discursive power of the West. CCTV (now CGTN) China’s premier broadcaster global expansion has risen manifold after the decision to go global was taken. CCTV claims to have achieved global coverage with its. CCTV4. It’s a Mandarin-language channel whose target audience is overseas Chinese-speaking viewers. The channel reaches approx 10 million viewers outside China in 93 countries. There’s another channel which has helped its global reach, CCTV-9, a foreign-language channel (English, French &amp; Spanish). It has some 40 million viewers overseas in 94 countries.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The editorial policy of a news media outlet varies according to the region, the tensions in the surroundings as well the political environment of the region. Although it would seem that the editorial policies of the above-discussed media outlets are similar, it’d be wrong to make a quick judgement. A quick glance at their websites gives a clear picture of the kind of stories they do and what do they want to tell the world through those stories.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The year has been scarred by one of the most significant events of the century. The COVID-19 virus has disrupted more lives than the two World Wars combined. Despite the severity of the disease and the grave threat that it poses, India has faced the virus on a war footing, doing the utmost it can at home and simultaneously following a rigorous foreign policy to ensure a global approach to the problem at hand and any such conceivable problems in the future. Some major updates to cover in today’s<mark> Foreign Policy</mark>&nbsp;Report are as follow:</p>



<h3><strong>India-US, Foreign Office Consultations</strong></h3>



<p>Historically, India has always chosen to tread the neutral path when it has been faced with the decision of choosing a side in geopolitics, especially during the Nehruvian years, that is immediately after it attained independence, where it followed a strict policy of non-alignment. However, in recent times as India has chosen to increase its influence and emerge as an important geopolitical leader in the South-Asian region, it has substantially increased its cooperation and strengthened its ties with the United States. The latest developments between the two nations include a set of <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-india-foreign-office-consultations-2/">Foreign Office Consultations</a>. The virtual meeting took place between the Foreign Secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, and the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, David Hale. Given the current situation where the virus is surging by leaps and bounds in both countries, the two representatives agreed to further strengthen the health partnership, including in the areas of pharmaceuticals and vaccine development. </p>



<p>They further agreed to ensure the enhancement of mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties. During this discussion, the Indian delegation addressed the issues regarding the VISA facilitation post-COVID, especially keeping in mind professionals and students. Following this, the two representatives moved on to address the elephant in the room, the Indo-Pacific, that has come to be seen as one of the most strategically important regions in the world, with 75% of world trade passing through the region. Keeping in mind India’s geographic proximity to the region and the US’ trade and military interests, both nations have persevered in the past to ensure a free open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, against China’s predatory approach. The following consultation acted as a testimony to India-US joint initiatives in the Indo-Pacific in the future. Lastly, the United States emphasised the US-India cooperation in the United Nation, especially after India was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the year 2020-21.</p>



<h3><strong>India-European Union Summit</strong></h3>



<p>India’s increased engagement in the Western Indian Ocean regions has led to the country cooperating and investing in strategic relationships with several European Nations. The 15th meeting of the <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/32817/IndiaEuropean_Union_Summit">India-European Union</a> summit is scheduled to be held virtually. The meeting was co-chaired by the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, the President of the European Union, H.E Charles, and the President of the European Commission, H.E Ursula Von Der Leyen. The summit that is to be held in the coming days will mainly focus on India-EU cooperation covering political and security relations and at the same time will look into avenues of trade and investment. The summit would mainly be addressing the issues of development during the COVID 19 pandemic and contemporary global matters.</p>



<h3><strong>Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border Affairs</strong></h3>



<p>India has been locking horns with the Chinese Republic over several issues. Most recent of these has been the border situation, at the Galwan Valley. On the 10th of July, 2020. The 16th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/india-china-border-standoff-long-road-ahead-next-wmcc-to-take-place-soon/2020446/">India-China Border Affairs</a> was held. The Indian delegation was led by the Joint Secretary (East Asia) from the Ministry of External Affairs. Meanwhile, the Chinese delegation was led by the Director-General of the Boundary and Oceanic Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Before deliberating over the future steps in regards to the de-escalation in violence at the border regions, the two delegations looked back at the agreements between the two nations. The first of these agreements were between the two foreign ministers on the 17th of June, following which there was an agreement reached between special representatives on the 5th of July. The recent consultation essentially reviewed the situation at the India-China border including the progress made in terms of the ongoing disengagement of troops. It was decided that another meeting of the WMCC will be conducted in the future, followed by a meeting of the Senior Commanders, which will discuss further steps to ensure a complete disengagement and de-escalation in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>High-Level Summit of the United Nations Economic and Social Council</strong></h3>



<p>The Prime Minister recently delivered the keynote address at a high-level summit of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on the 17th of July. PM Narendra Modi had previously addressed the member nations of the council in 2016 at the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ecosoc-address-pm-modi-pitches-for-un-reforms-during-says-it-should-reflect-today-s-realities-1701702-2020-07-17">ECOSOC</a>. This time around the Prime Minister delivered his address at the Valedictory session, where he was joined by the Prime Minister of Norway and the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The summit attracted a diverse set of representatives from several nations. The Conference that celebrated the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, bears the theme of ‘Multilateralism after COVID 19: What kind of United Nations do we need at the 75th anniversary’. The session that primarily focused on bolstering leadership through global cooperation and international institutions, was the first opportunity the Indian Prime Minister had to address member nations since India got elected to the United Nations Security Council. The Summit acts to India’s advantage as it aligns with India’s Security Council priority, wherein India has emphasised the need for reformed multilateralism in a post-COVID-19 world. The session also recalled India’s role as a holder of the inaugural Presidency of the Economic and Social Council.</p>

<h3><strong>International Appointments</strong></h3>



<p>Jawed Ashraf, the Indian Ambassador to the French Republic has been concurrently accredited as the Ambassador to Principality of Monaco. At the same time Dr Vidya P Nair, who currently serves as a Director in the Ministry of External Affairs, has been designated as the next Ambassador to Turkmenistan. Lastly, Shri Hemant Harishchandra Kotalwar, presently Joint Secretary on deputation to NCSC has recently taken up the position of the next Ambassador to the Czech Republic.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>India has for long followed an inward-facing forward policy, that did not prioritise bilateral relations and strategic partnerships and adopted a neutral stance on geopolitical matters. However, that is not the case anymore. With the given situation that the country finds itself in regards to the Chinese Republic, and the leadership position it has assumed after the Indian Prime Minister addressed nations at the Shangri-La dialogue, India has further increased its relations with European Nations and further strengthened its bilateral relations with the United States, to an extent where India has been promoted to the status, generally granted to treaty allies. With India’s burgeoning interest in geopolitics, India’s current foreign policy decisions will shape the position it assumes in the post-pandemic world order.&nbsp;</p>
