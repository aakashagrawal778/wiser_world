<p>K-pop, the popular music that originated in South Korea is taking over the whole world with the raging popularity of K-pop groups like BTS, Black Pink, GOT7, Monsta X, and many more. The whole K-pop idea was introduced as a distinct traineeship modal in the South Korean music industry which is now followed by the rest of the entertainment industry. The growing popularity of the K-pop industry is not only promoting the Korean culture over the world, even into countries like Chile, Afghanistan, and Middle East but is also making a strong impact on the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/decoding-south-koreas-economy/">South Korean economy</a>. The way this industry is growing, K-pop is sure to propel the South Korean economy in the years ahead.</p>



<p>So, the whole concept of K-pop dominance all over the world is known as “<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/bts-tops-billboard-100-list-how-k-pop-helped-korea-improve-its-economy/articleshow/65266543.cms">Hallyu</a>”, a Chinese word that stands for the Korean wave of pop culture. The continuous growth of Hallyu resulted in increased distribution and consumption of Korean content through platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and SNS. Even the incredible and first-ever success of director Bong Joon-Ho’s film <em>Parasite</em> also helped in Hallyu content and the Korean film/entertainment in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>A Little Into Hallyu Background and Present State</strong></h2>



<p>In 1992, the Korean Culture and Tourism Institute send a copy of a drama to play into the other countries, with the support of the South Korean government. The government helps these industries to go and other things also. The projects that helped in the spread of Hallyu are – boys over flower, my seesy girl, Swiri, Autumn in my heart also the songs SHINee&#8217;s ring ding ding, PSY Gangnam Style, Rain’s bad boy. These become popular not only in the parts of Asia but also among the youth of other countries like the US and the UK. When it comes to Hallyu there are five main factors one shouldn&#8217;t forget. The impact starts with lifting the ban on foreign travel for Korean citizens, along with Korean chaebols restructuring. Samsung also considers another main factor of the Korean wave. The rise of Samsung was another era for the South Korean economy and Hallyu. Branding of Korean companies and banning censorship lows, giving opportunities to other citizens to come and learn K-pop is another highlight of the K-pop era. As Barak Obama <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2199-8531/3/4/22/pdf">said </a>the entertainment industry of K-pop in South Korea is the government’s priority.</p>



<p>Every Korean brand promotes its ad along with a K-pop idol or actor, which helps when the protagonist of the ad goes overseas, they help the brand to promote overseas. The wave of Korean pop culture has great support from the government from the past. Korean pop culture has a great impact on Asian countries like China, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. The Hallyu itself a mandarin word. The K-pop industry is joined by trainees from China, Thailand, and Japan. Many of K-pop group consists of Chinese, Thai and Japanese members along with Korean members with their nationality abroad, which helps them to gain popularity among the countries and reach achievements. Many Korean idols, singers, actors have also signed many sub-labels in other countries due to the increase of Hallyu. The rising popularity of the entertainment industries not only promoting Hallyu but also giving a high rise to the Korean government.&nbsp; The growth of the Korean wave over the last two decades is fantastic and giving a major impact on the Korean economy. </p>



<h2><strong>K-popnomy</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to the K-pop music industry, five to eight K-pop music labels are offering a huge range in the Korean economy. Such labels are Big Hit Entertainment, SM Entertainment, JYP Official, Starship Official, and many more. The chairman of SM Entertainment, Lee Soo-man told a recent seminar that he believed k- pop would grow through technological innovation and even Hallyu celebrities in all powered avatars could even become part of our lives. According to Korea foundation president Lee gum, Hallyu has not only become a global content but an asset to South Korea’s pubic diplomacy. CNN published the article with the headline after the sudden popularity of K-pop song Gangnam Style by PSY released in 2012, “Korean wave of pop culture swipes across Asia.”</p>



<p>Being the uppermost country with the determined goal to become the most popular culture leading exporter South Korea along with its government supporting the entertainment industries to grow higher and reach audiences all over the world. Also, we can say it’s the way to develop the soft power of the country. With the blessing of the biggest cultural phenomena across Asia and another part of the globe Hallyu, Korea expands its businesses, culture, and country image.</p>
