<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">In the era of conversational improvisations, network developers extend their utmost interest in developing more precise and fast networks. A lot of things have changed in modern times and have been shaped in a much better way. This can be seen as we advance our interests and change our perspectives as we did from telephones to current day smartphones. This transcends it completely due to our ever-increasing requirements and interests.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In the field of telecommunication, major emphasis relies on the consumers&#8217; need and work purpose for example if there is a demand for faster network it is quite obvious that we will switch to that network. In the chain of fast-growing networks, 5G is a new member and most advanced too.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The term 5-G Pioneer Band was first coined by <strong><em>Professor Stephen Temple</em></strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">This technology replaces the old 3G and 4G networks, which were slower than the proposed 5G network.</p>



<h3><strong>Detailed Study</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Like earlier networks, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5G network</a> or fifth generation network is a cellular network in which the service area is distributed into small geographical regions called&nbsp;<em>cells.</em> All 5G wireless devices are commonly joined to the&nbsp;internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;telephone network&nbsp;by radio waves&nbsp;through a local antenna&nbsp;in the cell. &nbsp;The main advantage of this network is that they will have greater&nbsp;bandwidth, giving higher&nbsp;download speeds.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected that the new network will not only work for cell phones like the present cellular networks but is also usable as general&nbsp;Internet Service Providers (ISP) for laptops and PCs, competing with present ISPs such as optical fiber network and will add new applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and machine to machine communication.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Higher-frequency radio waves have a shorter range than the frequencies used by older cell-phone networks, requiring smaller cells. 5G network works upon three frequency bands low, medium, and high. A 5G network will be developed from 3 different types of cells, each one needing different antennas, giving a different trade-off speed for different range and service areas.</p>



<h3><strong>Properties of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The fifth-generation; network derives information from the wireless router through an electromagnetic spectrum, usually from radio spectra. A radio spectrum consists of various types of frequency bands.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network is still not available in many countries around the globe but India is amongst the fortunate countries which had access to this technology. 5G network was <a href="https://www.news18.com/videos/ivideos/jio-5g-affordable-smartphone-with-google-jiomart-and-other-key-announcements-at-ril-agm-2020-2722577.html">introduced by Reliance Jio</a> in India.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The frequency of radio waves ranges between 3 kHz and 300 GHz but this technology is in its development phase so we canâ€™t imagine getting the maximum speed offered by this spectrum. Radio band is categorized as Extremely Low Frequency <strong>(ELP)</strong>, Ultra Low Frequency <strong>(ULF)</strong>, Low Frequency <strong>(LF)</strong>, Medium Frequency <strong>(MF)</strong>, Ultra High Frequency <strong>(UHF)</strong> and Extremely High Frequency <strong>(EHF)</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The high-frequency range between 30-300 GHz is called millimeter band, and its wavelength varies from 1-10 mm. Wavelength around this range is termed as millimeter waves. This kind of waves is essential for the development of the 5<sup>th</sup> generation network.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The radio spectrum in 5G spectrum is shown below.</p>

<h3><strong>How 5G Network is Better than Prior Networks</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network or the modern-day generation is best known for its ultra-high-speed, high accuracy and accessibility. The area of its application makes our day to day life easier. The process of downloading, uploading and syncing has been reduced to a great extent. Now everyone could enjoy their favorite shows and web series without any pause. High efficiency has played a humangous role in 5G network&#8217;s success. This prevents buffering of content like audio, video and helps in faster data processing.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The 4<sup>th </sup>generation network was unstable and its connection speed was much lower than the 5<sup>th</sup> generation network.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Bandwidth </strong>is the amount of data that can be transferred through a network at a given time which means that under ideal conditions if any other devices or interferences affect the speed, a device could theoretically experience&nbsp;<em>peak speeds.</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to which <strong><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">5G is 20 times faster than 4G</a>.</strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In 5G network, the size of the antenna was very different than that of the 4G network. Due to shorter wavelengths, <strong>shorter antennas </strong>are made for the nascently discovered network.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-1024x661.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2189" width="508" height="328" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-1024x661.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-300x194.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-768x496.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /><figcaption><em>Source:<a href="https://blogs.3ds.com/simulia/5g-antenna-design-mobile-phones/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dassault SystÃ¨mes</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Another difference is 5G network can more easily be understood by the type of data being requested, and can swap into a lower power mode when not in use or when supplying low rates to specific devices, and also turn into a high-powered mode for HD video&nbsp;streaming.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Where 4G lags in providing all the data, needed to a growing number of users and mobile devices, 5G opens the airwaves for more internet based technologies like smart traffic lights, wireless sensors, wearable gadgets, etc.</p>



<h3><strong>Application of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network is broadly used in enhanced mobile broadband, mission critical communications and massive IOTs.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G finds its major use in development of new technologies. High speed network connections are made possible due to this approach.</p>



<h3><strong>Working of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p>Following are the <a href="https://www.rfpage.com/how-5g-technology-works/#:~:text=%205G%20Technologies%20%E2%80%93%20How%20does%20it%20work%3F,It%20allows%20the%20user%20to%20connect...%20More%20" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ways 5G network works</a>:</p>



<h4><strong><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Carrier Aggregation</strong></strong></h4>



<p>Carrier aggregation is used to improve the system efficiency. In this method, two or more carrier signals are aggregated to support wider bandwidth of upto 100 MHz.</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> Intra-band contiguous</strong>: Two carriers are transmitted at neighboring channels</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Intra-band non-contiguous</strong>: Two carriers are transmitted with channel spacing.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Inter-band</strong>: In this technique different LTE bands are used for transmission simultaneously.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="453" height="203" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unnamed-1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-2191"/><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://blogs.3ds.com/simulia/5g-antenna-design-mobile-phones/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telecom ABC</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h4><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Small Cell Concept</strong></h4>



<h4>In order to enhance efficiency, the cell is divided into micro and pico sections. Spectrum reusability allows adding more users in a small geographical area and handle network more efficiently.&nbsp;</h4>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>MIMO Concept</strong></h4>



<p>MIMO is a technology which consists of multiple antennas for transmission and reception. Number of antennas is directly proportional to transmission and reception.</p>



<h4>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WiFi offloading</strong></h4>



<p>Wi-fi offloading is the main feature of future networks. It allows us to connect using wi-fi and cellular networks can be allocated to other users. It is suitable for those places where cellular network quality is extremely poor but the user still has the option to connect to the network without cellular reception.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Device to Device Communication</strong></h4>



<p>In the D2D communication network, two adjacent devices communicate with each other directly. Network has control over the devices and use the operator to determine the traffic routing between direct and network path.</p>



<h4><strong>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; Cloudâ€“Radio Network Access</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;C-RAN is used for effective communication within a centralized information processing done distinctly within the cloud system. It offers a lot of benefits in system implementation, maintenance and is highly efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Research based on Health Implications of 5G</strong></h3>



<p>The most recent approach in 5G is based on its health impacts over humans, animals and vegetations. The wide usage of 2G, 3G and 4G networks have already shown its adverse health consequences due to radiofrequency exposures. &nbsp;Scientists are taking precautions before switching to 5G.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ehtrust.org/scientific-research-on-5g-and-health/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, the wide-spectrum of drastic health conditions of non-ionizing non-visible radiation and 5G mobile networking technology will affect not only the skin and eyes but will also have an adverse systemic effect too. They stated that 5G will increase the cell tower densities by an order of magnitude which can prove to be a fatal health disaster.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>To conclude with, we can see wide usage of 5G in many countries but their usage is also prohibited in some countries due to health precautions and predictions by scientists in that particular nation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exposure to RF radiation according to FCC guidelines can result in:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Carcinogenicity</strong>: Tumors, Breast Cancers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Geno-toxicity</strong>: DNA damage, DNA repair inhibitions, variation in chromatin structures</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mutagenicity, Teratogenicity and Neurodegenerative diseases.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF 5-G IN FUTURE</strong></h3>



<p>We will surely witness further more development of this technology in future.</p>



<p>Advancement will surely take place in the technology to make it better so our health will not suffer badly and no threats would imply over using this technology.</p>
