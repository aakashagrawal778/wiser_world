<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Since the beginning of mankind, humans asserted largely over finding better modes of transportation to improve their experience and it could also save a large amount of time. Due to this many inventions took place; until the Wright Brothers developed the world&#8217;s first successful motor-operated airplane. Now, we can also see drones or UAVs working on the same technology.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is a link between a train and an airplane because its shape resembles a train while its projected speed is similar to that of an aeroplane. It is the most recent approach in the field of passenger and goods transportation proposed by the CEO and owner of Space X, Elon Musk.</p>



<h3><strong>Explaination and Detailed Study</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size">The concept of Hyperloop consists of a sealed tube or connection of tubes with low air pressure in which a pod can travel in the absence of friction and air resistance. This was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-hyper-loop-2012-9?IR=T">proposed </a>by Elon Musk in 2012. His initial research and planning constituted reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules travel in air bearings driven by a linear induction motor and axial compressors. This project was open-sourced for individuals and other private ventures. Currently, the Mumbair-Pune corridor is officially researching this concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Hyperloop_pod_competition_tube-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2471" width="381" height="254" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Hyperloop_pod_competition_tube-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Hyperloop_pod_competition_tube-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Hyperloop_pod_competition_tube-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1200px-Hyperloop_pod_competition_tube-1.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></figure></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>



<h3><strong>Theory based on Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop concept relies largely on the reduction of friction and air resistance which implies that one needs to create a vacuum inside the sealed tube so that fast propagation would take place, but we also know creating a complete vacuum inside a free space is nearly impossible. Hyperloop is a vactrain system with a pressure of 100 pascals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2477" width="487" height="324" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1.png 600w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption><em>Hyperloop diagram based on design by Elon Musk</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For the propagation, the shape and size of the pod matters a lot and especially if we are moving inside a tunnel-like tube. According to the original concept put forward by Elon Musk the capsule or pods will float (0.5-1.3 mm) layer of air beneath it.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The pressure to “skis”. Another hyperloop technology involves <strong>Maglev. </strong>Maglev is a system of train transportation using two sets of magnets. One to push the train off the track and another to pull it forward.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The linear induction motors&nbsp;located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the required speed and this will vary for each section of the tube route. In the earlier hyperloop concept conceptualised by Elon Musk an electric driven fan or inlet fan is attached in    front of capsule like the axial compressor in older aeroplanes.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Talking about the shape, the proposed design of the hyperloop is 7ft 4 inches in diameter, and the projected speed of the same is 1220km/hr, maintaining aero-dynamic efficiency, which is much greater than a passanger aeroplane which moves with the highest speed of 930 km/hr.</p>



<h3><strong>Constructional Research on Capsules</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is built by a new type of carbon fibre composite which is eight times stronger than aluminium and ten times than steel accessories. It is also much less in weight about 1.5 times less heavy than aluminium, this composite is named as “<strong><em>Vibranium</em></strong>” based on the 2018 hollywood movie <strong>Black Panther</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The pods will be prepared using two layers of Vibranium one for the inside and other for the outside layers of hyperloop capsule.</p>



<h3><strong>Fuel based Research on Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is better than air passenger transport and high-speed rails because it rarely produces any noise and is environmental-friendly. No green house gases are released in this process making it a better and more sustainable mode of transport.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The modern-day hyperloops are electric, they are similar to electric cars. With hyperloop, we eliminate sources, like wheels on a track, and we actually have a sound barrier inherent in our tube design. There is no chance of noise and air pollution and thus there are no health adversities.</p>



<h3><strong>Cost Estimation and Expenses of Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The constructional cost by Hyperloop one was estimated to be somewhere between 19 to 20 billion Euros or 22 billion USD according to 2016, there might be variation in prices today. Also, there will be a variation in expenses as hyperloop will be more expensive than aeroplane, all because of creation of vacuum needs large and expensive machines and the carbon synthesis material is hard to prepare.</p>



<h3><strong>Technologies Associated to Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are many technologies associated to hyperloop and works similarly, which includes Swiss Metro, SG Maglev; that has devised a train in Japan which does not need vacuum tubes and run with the speed of 630 km/hr, which is also the fastest train in the world and it is designed using aerodynamic shape. The major challenge in the success of hyperloop is the already running trains with such a high speed. Though Hyperloop is in its development phase, we can witness its speed which is estimated using a partial vacuum model as creating a complete vacuum is a myth until someone makes it possible.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;In 2015 Space-X announced its competition, in which more than 700 teams participated in the event and showcased their innovation of pod designs, material and most importantly safety implications which are still not resolved, because of which many people criticize this very idea of Hyperloop.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Another event took place which also acted as a competition of speed and Technical University of Munich won the contest with a speed of 324-330 km/hr.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">But in the third competition which took place in 2018 with proper safety precautions, the Technical University of Munich recreated a record by beating their previous record, this time the highest attained speed was 463 km/hr.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">But still problem remained the same Hyperloop is much behind the Shanghai Maglev or SG Maglev.</p>



<h3><strong>Countries Initiating Hyperloop Projects</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Countries have deep interests in developing this project. Major initiatives have been taken by major superpowers like the USA where this project was first started. Many institutes and private companies are researching on this project in order to finish this project and accomplish the assigned speed of 1220 km/hr, countries like China are researching for trains similar to hyperloop.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While Japan is searching for faster maglev trains using the same technology. Hyperloop project is also attaining speed in Dubai and India.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop Transporting Technology will start its human trials in 2020 by completing its pod or capsule development. For now, only a few people can travel using this technology.</p>



<h3><strong>India&#8217;s Approach</strong> <strong>and Projects on Hyperloop</strong></h3>

</div>
</div>
</div></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India is the only country that is officially pertaining to hyperloop technology for <strong>Mumbai-Pune corridors</strong>. The Hyperloop project will be based on the ‘Swiss Challenge Method’. This project will be done in association with Virgin Hyperloop One.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Amongst many grounded projects <strong>Amaravati via Vijayawada</strong> is also one of them it was proposed by Government of Andhra Pradesh and it was done in association with HTT USA.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;The US based company did all the surveys and planned for appropriate capsules and the 700 km was setup by which this loop line could have connected <strong>Anantapur, Vijayawada, Amravati, Vizag</strong> but all this changed and project stopped after the election and ruling party changed.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Delhi via Mumbai</strong> connecting<strong> Jaipur </strong>and<strong> Indore</strong> is also amongst the incomplete projects due to lack of interest by the government because of the other ongoing issues. This project was set forward by DGW Hyperloop, Indore. This loop is 1317 km long, and it claims to cover the distance between Mumbai and Delhi in just 80 mins that’s hard to believe but it is true as the company had already done all its trials.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Amritsar via Chandigarh </strong>connecting <strong>Ludhiana</strong> was proposed in August 2019 and is in progress, this project was sanctioned at the cost of Rs 56,000 crore. This project is stopped due to nationwide lockdown. Virgin Hyperloop One which is the most recent HT claims that distance between two cities can be summarised from 5 hours to mere 30 min. This loop was decided to be 232km in length.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"></div></div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Amongst all these projects the best project is <strong>Mumbai to Pune project </strong>Virgin Hyperloop One was all set with its planning and <strong>Devendra Fradnavis </strong>then C.M. of Maharashtra initiated this project and this project was assigned to Pune Metropolitan Development Authority, this was made with an initiative to reduce time of travelling from 3 hours to 20 mins. This project was successful as Virgin Hyperloop and DP World together invested $ 500 million, but all this changed when the Devendra Fadnavis government was replaced with the present coalition government led by Uddhav Thackrey.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Hyperloop and Future of Pods and Tubes</strong></h3>



<p>Hyperloop is better than any other land or track transport because it essentially does not release any harmful gases or chemicals into the environment and by adding little more speed it can become the fastest means of transportation. It may be more expensive than air transport but is safer because there is a specified area designed for its propagation while aeroplane and helicopter are riskier as they fly freely in the open air.</p>



<p>The future of pods indicates to redesigning of the pods so that the desired speed could be attained and tubes need to be aligned at the fixed angle so that there is no chance of accidents.</p>



<p>The hardest and the most dreadful task is to create vacuum so that high speed propagation of capsules can be done, which needs to be rectified.</p>



<p>We will surely witness the advancement in this field in the near future as no one could assure the confirm completion of this project which is seemingly futuristic.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Speed enhancement is the major factor in development of HLTT.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The speed of Hyperloop is increasing slowly and gradually and the breakthrough in the same could be achieved if we are able to achieve the vacuum state where there is no air, but it also poses risk of alignment and directions because slight variation in the same could lead to accidents although magnet protects them from getting out of their way and thus they remain over the track.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In an augmented form development of the hyperloop, it seems like a difficult task, but it is not impossible at the same time.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In short, this development is a revolutionary approach and will add greater value to our present day transportation facilities.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Marijuana is a mixture of the dried flowers belonging to Cannabis Sativa. It is popular by other terms like pot, herb, weed, mary jane, ganja and other slang words. Marijuana is smoked by people either in the form of a rolled-cigarette known as joints, in pipes, through bongs or rolled in cigar wraps (blunts). <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-marijuana">Marijuana</a> is mixed into food items like candies, brownies or cookies when sold or consumed for medical purposes apart from that it can be used to brew tea.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Charas, marijuana, bhang are derivatives of cannabis, which are popular in tradition and are used by adolescents. While some people get dependent on it others leave it after early experimentation. The drug has been legal for most of human history and illegal for 1% of the time since the time its been in use.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>MARIJUANA IN INDIA</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In India, Cannabis has been in use since 2000 BC. A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences in the year 2019 shows that cannabis has been consumed by 7.2 billion Indians in the past year. As per the 2016 drug report of UNODC, the retail price of cannabis was the lowest in the world at US$0.10 per gram. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 is the central law that deals with cannabis in India. Although, states have their laws regarding the sale, consumption or use of marijuana. In general, it is seen as a crime and can land someone in trouble. In India, Uttarakhand was the first state to allow the cultivation of Hemp for commercial purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Under the 1985 act, anyone found engaged in the practice trade or consumption of Cannabis or bud can be made liable for an imprisonment of up to 20 years. Even the possession of drugs attracts legal charges which depend upon the quantity in the possession and the purpose does not matter. The production of hemp and marijuana is also strictly banned in the country. However, the state governments have been vested with the power to grant cultivation license for some purposes (medical and research). Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the two northern Indian states have received the license to cultivate hemp.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The Indian market for cannabis has received attention recently due to various NGOs and activists filing petitions to legalise it. The arguments often point towards the medical benefits which cannot be ignored and the boost that it can bring for the Indian economy with millions of jobs due to ideal climatic conditions required for cultivation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India shares a medicinal and mythical history with Marijuana. It&#8217;s been in the lives of people for centuries now. In 1986, Under the pressure of the medical lobby of the US, the country gave in and formed strict narcotic laws that prohibited the production, sale, consumption and transportation of drugs illegal. Since then, arguments in favour of legalising this drug and keeping it banned have been made. The ban did not bring much change, except for the fact that a legal source of government income has been shifted to international drug groups.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>COMPARISION WITH THE WORLD</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The cannabis was legalised for medical purposes by Germany in the year 2017, which left a remark on other EU members. The recent rise in interest and investment by the Uk and Europe in the medical cannabis market is the result of deregulation of cannabis for medical causes. Denmark, Poland, Portugal and the UK have changed their regulations related to medical cannabis. In November 2019, the NHS in England approved two cannabis-based medicines which were used to treat epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Uruguay, Canada and other<a href="https://thewire.in/health/cannabis-marijuana-india-legal"> 11 US states</a> legalised the export, import, possession, distribution of cannabis for research and medical purposes. Luxembourg, who legalised the market for medical purposes now intends to loosen their laws further to legalise its production and consumption, it would be the first European country to do so. Only four countries have accepted and allowed the medical and recreational use of cannabis which are Uruguay, Canada, Georgia and South Africa.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India might have taken its first step towards legalising Cannabis. The Delhi high court in 2019, served a notice to the centre challenging the prohibition on the plant snd demanding justification for criminalising it for industrial and medical purposes. Uttarakhand already came out in open when it allowed the cultivation of hemp in 1000 hectares of land in 2018, which can be sold to the government only. The court’s notice is the result of a PIL filed by the great legalization movement India trust (<a href="https://www.glm.org/">GLM</a>) which is a non-profit organisation working towards raising awareness about the medical, industrial, economical and other benefits of cannabis while making efforts to decriminalise it. The petition challenged certain provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, which banned the use of Cannabis. The medical benefits of the drug were pointed out and alleged that banning it violates Article 21 (Right to life) of the constitution.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Cultivation of the drug is illegal in India. However, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research received permission from the health ministry to cultivate the crop in j&amp;k in the year 2017 solely for medical purposes. while the industrial, medical and recreation use of the drug is illegal in India. It is receiving acceptance across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The cannabis market has been misunderstood in India for a larger part of it. The laws are outdated and require re-consideration. The increasing support for the market and the rising number of hemp and cannabis seems encouraging. The economic and medical benefits that India would derive from the market cannot be ignored, considering the circumstances of support received by the drug; it might not be long that the Indian government unlocks the potential to legalise the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Studies show that marijuana is less harmful than other drugs like cocaine, morphine, alcohol etc, and provide relaxation and comfort to the senses, unlike others which lead to aggression in most cases. The country has taken significant steps towards legalising marijuana for medical purposes and it might someday allow the industrial benefits to expand too. Moreover, its legalisation would stop illegal international drug groups to enter and harm the economy as before its criminalisation it used to be a source of income for the state. A check on the use can be maintained as prevention often makes a drug stronger.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">In the era of conversational improvisations, network developers extend their utmost interest in developing more precise and fast networks. A lot of things have changed in modern times and have been shaped in a much better way. This can be seen as we advance our interests and change our perspectives as we did from telephones to current day smartphones. This transcends it completely due to our ever-increasing requirements and interests.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In the field of telecommunication, major emphasis relies on the consumers&#8217; need and work purpose for example if there is a demand for faster network it is quite obvious that we will switch to that network. In the chain of fast-growing networks, 5G is a new member and most advanced too.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The term 5-G Pioneer Band was first coined by <strong><em>Professor Stephen Temple</em></strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">This technology replaces the old 3G and 4G networks, which were slower than the proposed 5G network.</p>



<h3><strong>Detailed Study</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Like earlier networks, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5G network</a> or fifth generation network is a cellular network in which the service area is distributed into small geographical regions called&nbsp;<em>cells.</em> All 5G wireless devices are commonly joined to the&nbsp;internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;telephone network&nbsp;by radio waves&nbsp;through a local antenna&nbsp;in the cell. &nbsp;The main advantage of this network is that they will have greater&nbsp;bandwidth, giving higher&nbsp;download speeds.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected that the new network will not only work for cell phones like the present cellular networks but is also usable as general&nbsp;Internet Service Providers (ISP) for laptops and PCs, competing with present ISPs such as optical fiber network and will add new applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and machine to machine communication.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Higher-frequency radio waves have a shorter range than the frequencies used by older cell-phone networks, requiring smaller cells. 5G network works upon three frequency bands low, medium, and high. A 5G network will be developed from 3 different types of cells, each one needing different antennas, giving a different trade-off speed for different range and service areas.</p>



<h3><strong>Properties of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The fifth-generation; network derives information from the wireless router through an electromagnetic spectrum, usually from radio spectra. A radio spectrum consists of various types of frequency bands.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network is still not available in many countries around the globe but India is amongst the fortunate countries which had access to this technology. 5G network was <a href="https://www.news18.com/videos/ivideos/jio-5g-affordable-smartphone-with-google-jiomart-and-other-key-announcements-at-ril-agm-2020-2722577.html">introduced by Reliance Jio</a> in India.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The frequency of radio waves ranges between 3 kHz and 300 GHz but this technology is in its development phase so we can’t imagine getting the maximum speed offered by this spectrum. Radio band is categorized as Extremely Low Frequency <strong>(ELP)</strong>, Ultra Low Frequency <strong>(ULF)</strong>, Low Frequency <strong>(LF)</strong>, Medium Frequency <strong>(MF)</strong>, Ultra High Frequency <strong>(UHF)</strong> and Extremely High Frequency <strong>(EHF)</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The high-frequency range between 30-300 GHz is called millimeter band, and its wavelength varies from 1-10 mm. Wavelength around this range is termed as millimeter waves. This kind of waves is essential for the development of the 5<sup>th</sup> generation network.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The radio spectrum in 5G spectrum is shown below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Don-Picture1-Frequency-bands-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2188" width="549" height="215" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Don-Picture1-Frequency-bands-1-1.png 838w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Don-Picture1-Frequency-bands-1-1-300x117.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Don-Picture1-Frequency-bands-1-1-768x301.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://insightaas.com/radio-spectrum-in-the-5g-wireless-world/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insightaas</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>How 5G Network is Better than Prior Networks</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network or the modern-day generation is best known for its ultra-high-speed, high accuracy and accessibility. The area of its application makes our day to day life easier. The process of downloading, uploading and syncing has been reduced to a great extent. Now everyone could enjoy their favorite shows and web series without any pause. High efficiency has played a humangous role in 5G network&#8217;s success. This prevents buffering of content like audio, video and helps in faster data processing.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The 4<sup>th </sup>generation network was unstable and its connection speed was much lower than the 5<sup>th</sup> generation network.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Bandwidth </strong>is the amount of data that can be transferred through a network at a given time which means that under ideal conditions if any other devices or interferences affect the speed, a device could theoretically experience&nbsp;<em>peak speeds.</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to which <strong><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">5G is 20 times faster than 4G</a>.</strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In 5G network, the size of the antenna was very different than that of the 4G network. Due to shorter wavelengths, <strong>shorter antennas </strong>are made for the nascently discovered network.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-1024x661.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2189" width="508" height="328" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-1024x661.png 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-300x194.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min-768x496.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/coupling-to-phone-resonances-min.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /><figcaption><em>Source:<a href="https://blogs.3ds.com/simulia/5g-antenna-design-mobile-phones/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dassault Systèmes</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Another difference is 5G network can more easily be understood by the type of data being requested, and can swap into a lower power mode when not in use or when supplying low rates to specific devices, and also turn into a high-powered mode for HD video&nbsp;streaming.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Where 4G lags in providing all the data, needed to a growing number of users and mobile devices, 5G opens the airwaves for more internet based technologies like smart traffic lights, wireless sensors, wearable gadgets, etc.</p>



<h3><strong>Application of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G network is broadly used in enhanced mobile broadband, mission critical communications and massive IOTs.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5G finds its major use in development of new technologies. High speed network connections are made possible due to this approach.</p>



<h3><strong>Working of 5G Network</strong></h3>



<p>Following are the <a href="https://www.rfpage.com/how-5g-technology-works/#:~:text=%205G%20Technologies%20%E2%80%93%20How%20does%20it%20work%3F,It%20allows%20the%20user%20to%20connect...%20More%20" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ways 5G network works</a>:</p>



<h4><strong><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Carrier Aggregation</strong></strong></h4>



<p>Carrier aggregation is used to improve the system efficiency. In this method, two or more carrier signals are aggregated to support wider bandwidth of upto 100 MHz.</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> Intra-band contiguous</strong>: Two carriers are transmitted at neighboring channels</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Intra-band non-contiguous</strong>: Two carriers are transmitted with channel spacing.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Inter-band</strong>: In this technique different LTE bands are used for transmission simultaneously.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="453" height="203" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unnamed-1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-2191"/><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://blogs.3ds.com/simulia/5g-antenna-design-mobile-phones/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telecom ABC</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h4><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Small Cell Concept</strong></h4>



<h4>In order to enhance efficiency, the cell is divided into micro and pico sections. Spectrum reusability allows adding more users in a small geographical area and handle network more efficiently.&nbsp;</h4>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>MIMO Concept</strong></h4>



<p>MIMO is a technology which consists of multiple antennas for transmission and reception. Number of antennas is directly proportional to transmission and reception.</p>



<h4>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WiFi offloading</strong></h4>



<p>Wi-fi offloading is the main feature of future networks. It allows us to connect using wi-fi and cellular networks can be allocated to other users. It is suitable for those places where cellular network quality is extremely poor but the user still has the option to connect to the network without cellular reception.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Device to Device Communication</strong></h4>



<p>In the D2D communication network, two adjacent devices communicate with each other directly. Network has control over the devices and use the operator to determine the traffic routing between direct and network path.</p>



<h4><strong>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; Cloud–Radio Network Access</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;C-RAN is used for effective communication within a centralized information processing done distinctly within the cloud system. It offers a lot of benefits in system implementation, maintenance and is highly efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Research based on Health Implications of 5G</strong></h3>



<p>The most recent approach in 5G is based on its health impacts over humans, animals and vegetations. The wide usage of 2G, 3G and 4G networks have already shown its adverse health consequences due to radiofrequency exposures. &nbsp;Scientists are taking precautions before switching to 5G.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ehtrust.org/scientific-research-on-5g-and-health/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, the wide-spectrum of drastic health conditions of non-ionizing non-visible radiation and 5G mobile networking technology will affect not only the skin and eyes but will also have an adverse systemic effect too. They stated that 5G will increase the cell tower densities by an order of magnitude which can prove to be a fatal health disaster.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>To conclude with, we can see wide usage of 5G in many countries but their usage is also prohibited in some countries due to health precautions and predictions by scientists in that particular nation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exposure to RF radiation according to FCC guidelines can result in:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Carcinogenicity</strong>: Tumors, Breast Cancers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Geno-toxicity</strong>: DNA damage, DNA repair inhibitions, variation in chromatin structures</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mutagenicity, Teratogenicity and Neurodegenerative diseases.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF 5-G IN FUTURE</strong></h3>



<p>We will surely witness further more development of this technology in future.</p>



<p>Advancement will surely take place in the technology to make it better so our health will not suffer badly and no threats would imply over using this technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Modernization of the world is marked by the innovation in Science and Technology. In recent times, there have been many technological advancements that spearhead us towards new levels of technological advancements. There has been a recent discovery of Quantum Dots that has found its utilization in the core section of Engineering and effects our day to day lives directly.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot">Quantum Dots</a> (QD) are synthesized by nanoscale crystals which can transmit electrons. When UV Rays or Ultraviolet Rays strike over these semiconductor nanoparticles, they can emit light of various colors which is visible due to variation of the wavelength of light rays. The various colour patterns are due to the variation of the wavelength of light rays.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In quantum dots, properties vary according to the shape and type of semiconductor material.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Russian physicist <strong><em>Alexei Ekimov</em></strong> studied in detail over the topics of nanocrystals of Copper Chloride and Cadmium Selenide in a molten glass matrix and he also observed the fluorescence and color gradients. He is credited as the founder of Quantum Dots discovery which dates back to 1977.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>Alexander Efros</em></strong> was the first scientist who theoretically explained the concept and <strong><em>Louis Brus </em></strong>introduced the Colloidal Quantum Dots Discovery.</p>



<h3><strong>Detailed Study</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Quantum Dots are light emitting sources and are also evolving as better forms of LEDs, also known as QLEDs. The color of light emission depends on the difference of the gap between the Valence Band and the Conduction Band which is categorized under the Band Theory which forms the basis of categorization of material whether it is conductor, insulator, or semiconductor.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These particles are very tiny for that reason we categorise this field in Quantum Mechanics. Whenever quantum dots are illuminated by UV Rays than their electrons can get excited to a higher state of energy. It was shown that electronic wave function in quantum dots resembles the ones in real atoms. The optical properties of spherical metallic quantum dots can be explained by <a href="http://www.thermopedia.com/content/956/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mie Scattering Theory</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Properties OF Quantum Dots</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Quantum dots have properties in between bulk semiconductors and discrete atoms or molecules. Their optoelectronic properties vary because of their size. Larger quantum dots of bigger diameter emit longer wavelengths, like Orange or Red, and those with smaller diameter emits shorter wavelengths of light like Green and Blue.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1967" width="411" height="411" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1.png 1000w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1-300x300.png 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1-150x150.png 150w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1-768x768.png 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/qdsizes-spectrum-1-400x400.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /><figcaption><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2015/11/20/quantum-dots-a-true-particle-in-a-box-system/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variation in wavelength of light when it passes through Quantum Dots</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>QLEDs versus LEDs </strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Quantum dot Light Emitting Diode or QLED is better than other types of LEDs because they are very small so they occupy very little space and the amount of light generated by them is brighter than normal LEDs in general.</p>



<h3><strong>Difference between the QLED and OLED</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topic_qled-tv-vs-oled-tv_1-min.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1968" width="523" height="294" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topic_qled-tv-vs-oled-tv_1-min.jpg 960w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topic_qled-tv-vs-oled-tv_1-min-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topic_qled-tv-vs-oled-tv_1-min-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /><figcaption><a href="https://news.samsung.com/za/qled-tv-vs-oled-tv" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">QLED vs OLED Panel</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">QLEDs are comparatively better than OLEDs because they emit more brightness and consume less energy. OLEDs are emissive which means the pixels emit their own light. QLEDs currently designed are transmissive and they fully depend on the LED backlight.</p>



<h3><strong>Problem Solving</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The most devastating impacts of LED is that of its high power consumption and utilities can be solved using QLEDs.</p>



<h4><strong>Modern Day Application</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These quantum dots are majorly used as QLEDs in quantum computing, but its use is limited due to its new discovery and high cost. They are also used in solar cells and forms the basis of laser emission. Solar panel is also based on Quantum Dot Theory. Single Electron Transistor and medical imaging can be accomplished using this technology. Due to its usage in fluids, we also use this in inkjet and laser printers’ ink.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-1024x558.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1965" width="679" height="370" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-1024x558.jpg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-768x419.jpg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-1536x838.jpg 1536w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CdSeqdots-min-1-2048x1117.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure></div>



<h4><strong>Plasma or Chemical Synthesis</strong></h4>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Plasma synthesis has been established as one of the most famous gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots,<strong> </strong>usually, for covalent atoms, for example, Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been synthesized by using non-thermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can be hindered using this method. Quantum dots generated by plasma are in powdered form. They can also be made using Carbon. Research-based on these methods is explained below:</p>



<h5><strong>Colloidal Synthesis</strong></h5>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In colloidal synthesis, the product neither precipitates as a bulk solid nor remains dissolved. It involves heating the solution at a very high temperature which is a major factor in determining the optimal conditions for nanocrystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that needs to be controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different phases, &#8216;focusing&#8217; and &#8216;defocusing&#8217;. At high monomer concentrations, the critical size is relatively small, resulting in the growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones as larger crystals require more atoms to grow resulting in &#8216;focusing&#8217; of size distribution, resulting in a discrete distribution of particles.</p>



<h3><strong>Research based on Colloidal Quantum Dots</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Colloidal Quantum Dots are solution synthesized semiconductors in low-cost photovoltaics. Change in solar cells absorption can take place using Tuning of Bandgaps, displaying the quantum size effects.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to a <a href="https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201001491">research</a> based on the Colloidal Quantum Dots by <strong><em>Jiang Tang</em></strong> and <strong><em>Edward H Sargent:</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Recent progress in this field involved the reduction of cost of solar cell composition and more eminent panels are build due to the usage of colloidal quantum dots, in addition to it colloidal quantum dots photovoltaics have contributed 5% increment in the solar power conversion efficiency, achieved by the introduction of a new architecture.</p>



<h3><strong>Reaseach based on Carbon Quantum Dots</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">According to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/cs/c4cs00269e#!divAbstract">research</a> based on the Carbon Quantum Dots by<strong> <em>Shi Ying Lim,</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>Wei Shen </em></strong>and<strong><em> Zhiqiang Gao:</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Fluorescent Carbon Nanoparticles or Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) are quality of carbon nanomaterials that have been nascently introduced and have gathered much interest in global market as a potential competitor to conventional semiconductor quantum dots. In addition to their comparable optical properties, they possess desired advantages of low toxicity, environmental friendliness low cost and simple synthetic routes. Since exploration, CQDs have found many applications in the fields of chemical sensing, biosensing, bioimaging, nanomedicine, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis.</p>



<h3><strong>Research based on Silicon and Germanium Quantum Dots</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-07-team-high-level-qubit-lifetime-based.html#:~:text=To%20resolve%20this%20problem%2C%20Prof.%20Li%20Hai-Ou%2C%20Prof.,the%20external%20magnetic%20field%20on%20spin%20relaxation%20rates">result</a> was formulated by <strong><em>Prof. Guo Guoping, Prof. Li Hai-Ou, </em></strong>team was led by<strong><em> Academician Guo Guoping.</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">They manufactured high-quality Si MOS quantum dots and achieved a record of spin qubits. Based on this technique, they found both the effect of strength and orientation of the external magnetic field on spin relaxation rates. They summarised when the in-plane external <a href="https://phys.org/tags/magnetic+field/">magnetic field</a> is positioned at a certain angle, the spin relaxation &#8216;hot spot&#8217; could be &#8216;cooled down&#8217; by two orders of magnitude. This work had a sprawling contribution in twisting the phenomena and solving the practical problems of optimum operating conditions to exploit the spin degrees of freedom in Silicon Quantum Dots.</p>



<h3><strong>QLED &#8211; A Game Changer in Near Future</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">QLED has transformed many things to build them more efficiently. From solar cells to normal LEDs quantum dots is tangible everywhere. We hope to witness much more developments in the upcoming days.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">To end with, I want to establish a fact that we can see new technology coming up but rarely use them because of its huge expense. However, its sprawling demand and ongoing innovation will surely depreciate its price and we will see a complete change of technology due to its widespread usage, one day.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Solar Eclipse or Suryan Grahan is when Moon comes between Sun and Earth and casts a shadow on a portion of Earth’s surface while partially or completely covering the Sun. This happens when Earth, Moon, and Sun are in ‘syzygy’ alignment. Eclipse, in general, is a phenomenon when a celestial body obscures the path of light emitted from a light-emitting body and casts its shadow on another body.</p>



<h2>How Does it Happen?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/solar-eclipse.png" alt=" Diagram explaining how solar eclipse happens" class="wp-image-1825" width="372" height="263" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/solar-eclipse.png 650w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/solar-eclipse-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /><figcaption>Diagram explaining how solar eclipse happens</figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Earth is revolving around the Sun in an elliptical orbit and Moon is revolving around Earth in an elliptical orbit as well. Now, ideally, we should be witnessing an eclipse every time we have a New Moon but that is not the case because of the slight tilt in the Moon’s orbit i.e., of over 5 degrees. Although, this is just a small tilt but is the reason why Moon does not cast a shadow covering the obscuring the Sun’s light on every New Moon. But on rare occasions, i.e., when Moon happens to be at the right position and close enough to Earth that its shadow falls perfectly on it, people present in that region witness a Total Solar Eclipse. Moreover, regions neighbouring the Total Eclipse region are also able to witness a Partial Eclipse due to a scientific phenomenon called ‘diffraction of light rays.’</p>



<h2>Different Phases of Sun During an Eclipse</h2>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Phases of the eclipse<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-8c4d932b-62bc-4262-9cdc-aaefd2e90843"></mark> can be broadly classified into two categories i.e., Partial Solar Eclipse and Total Solar Eclipse.</p>

</div>
</div>



<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Partial Solar Eclipse</span>: It happens when Sun and Moon are not in the exact position and Moon is only partially able to cover the Sun. This phenomenon is visible from a larger portion of Earth. Moon’s Penumbra is responsible for the formation of Partial Eclipse.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Solar Eclipse</span>: It is a rather rarer form of the eclipse as, during this, Moon totally covers the Sun leading to the famous formations also called as Ring of Fire where a fainter solar corona is visible. Moon’s Umbra is what causes a Total Solar Eclipse. A total eclipse can only be seen from a very narrow track on Earth’s surface which is called ‘Path of Totality’.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Apart from these two, there are two other types of solar eclipse that are:</p>



<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Annular Eclipse</span>: This is when the Sun and Moon fall in exactly the same line with Earth, but Moon being rather smaller than Sun, a much brighter Ring of Fire is visible also called ‘Annulus’.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hybrid Eclipse</span>: It is when there is a shift between a Total Solar Eclipse and an Annular Eclipse. Some parts of Earth witness it as a total eclipse while some witness it as an annular eclipse. This is the rarest of all forms of an eclipse<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-caf3c85d-d55b-4efc-9650-52a4648fbf92"></mark>.</li></ul>

<h3>Do&#8217;s and Don’ts During Solar Eclipse</h3>



<p><strong>DO&#8217;s:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Use special solar glasses or solar filter fitted telescopes and binoculars to look at the Sun.</li><li>Use a pinhole camera to observe the phases of the eclipse<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-398c8f82-f027-4a38-a41e-b165c52fe5da"></mark>.</li><li>Use special UV filters to take photos of the Sun during an eclipse.</li><li>Follow different phases of eclipse<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-f43f77a2-9253-44cb-9d18-138e12a5ac91"></mark> online on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2020-june-21">websites</a>.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>DON’Ts</strong></p>



<ul><li>Do not stare directly at the Sun.</li><li>Do not point your camera lens without UV filters at Sun for longer periods as the photosensor might get damaged by high-intensity sun rays.</li><li>Do not use home-made filters like X-Ray films, sunglasses, or CDs to look at Sun as they do only lower the brightness of rays but do not degrees the intensity of rays coming from the Sun.</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There is an activity guide by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOiYelzZHqAhWIeX0KHegaB2EQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feclipse2017.nasa.gov%2Fstatic%2Fimg%2Feclipse-kit%2FNASA_Eclipse_Activity_Guide.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw003tw2x2nau8Xk9D6NAW-E">NASA</a> which consists of fun activities and projects to be done at home during the eclipse.</p>



<h3>Formation of Crescents on the Ground During Solar Eclipse</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">On a normal clear day when sun rays fall through the leaves, nearly round-shaped shadows on the screen. But during the Solar Eclipse, as it approached totality, crescent-shaped shadows could be seen being formed on the screen (usually ground). This happens because in this scenario, light passing through those small gaps between leaves of trees essentially acts as pin hols cameras and they change shape as the Sun turns into a crescent, imitating the crescent shape of the Sun as it approaches Total Solar Eclipse.</p>

<h3>Superstitions Related to Eclipse in India</h3>



<ul><li>Temples are shut and it is prohibited to touch gods and idols are washed with water, Ganga Jal (water) to be specific.</li><li>People are advised not to consume any food. Even cooking during the eclipse is forbidden. People even leave tulsi on cooked food items to prevent it from spoiling during the eclipse.</li><li>People take bath as soon as the eclipse is over to wash the evil spirits away.</li><li>People are prohibited from urinating, defecating, eating, and even sexual intercourse during the eclipse.</li><li>In some parts of India, it is believed that pregnant women are most vulnerable during an eclipse hence they are prohibited from handling sharp objects during that period.</li></ul>
