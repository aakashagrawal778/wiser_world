<p class="has-drop-cap">In India, we live and breathe cinema aka Bollywood. The immense influence of films can be seen in how they dictate our sartorial choices, culinary choices and even our culture and perspective. In our country, culture and films are co-related and they evolve and alter with respect to each other. Probably this is why, the content of our Bollywood films and the criticism surrounding our films is imperative as “it allows us to view them differently, to look for unconscious social reality, the underlying power structures, the frames which melt into each other, the repetitive narrative patterns…” (Jain &amp; Rai, 2009). Be it the <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/08/04/hindi-cinema-nehruvian-era-political-awareness">Nehruvian socialism</a> which was reflected in the Bollywood films of the 50s or the emerging idea of nation and tradition in the 90s, films have always reflected and impacted the era they are produced in. The question of the portrayal of women in Bollywood is crucial as the films play a huge role in the way women in our society are perceived and treated.</p>



<h2><strong>Lac</strong>k<strong> </strong>o<strong>f </strong>W<strong>omen Identity and Agency</strong> in Bollywood</h2>



<p>The female protagonists in Bollywood films often lack a voice and agency. The story narrated is always that of the male hero and the female protagonist is a mere appendage. According to psychoanalytic theory, this could be termed as phallocentrism. Laura Mulvey in her essay ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ states that “the paradox of phallocentrism in all its manifestations is that it depends on the image of the castrated woman to give order and meaning to its world”. </p>



<p>The only role of the female characters is to further the plot of the story and to aid the hero in the process of identity-formation. Women, be it the sister, the mother or the love interest of the hero, are always secondary characters. Bollywood films like<em> Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Pardes</em> and the recent ones like <em>Dabangg, Zero </em>are a great example of this. It is always the hero who is shown in Bollywood movies to go through a journey and the women either are a cause of that journey or help him on his way. Rarely do we see independent women characters with well carved out identities.</p>



<p>Kareena Kapoor’s character in <em>Chameli </em>is one of such few examples of a well written, round female character. In the film, she emerges as a strong female character who does not need a male figure to rush to her rescue, every time she is in a problem. In fact, the film subverts the expectations of the audience in a scene where it is actually the street smart prostitute who rescues the hero.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>In a more recent film, <em>Thappad, </em>the issue of domestic violence, which has been plaguing our society since centuries, is addressed. Taapsee Punnu’s character stands against physical abuse. She refuses to bow down to the patriarchal ideas and in her journey, challenges the ‘sacred’ institutions of marriage and family. The film charts her growth from a dependent, almost subservient house-wife to an independent woman and a single mother. The film also breaks the stereotype that domestic violence is an issue only for the lower sections of society. In Thappad, we see how physical and mental abuse is as prevalent in urban, educated and rich families as among the poor, rural society.</p>

</div>
</div>



<h2><strong>Male Gaze</strong></h2>



<p>In most of our films, the gaze of the camera is also predominantly male and to a large extent, determines how we perceive the female characters. The male gaze of the camera is probably the result of the fact that the majority of the films are written, directed and shot by men. The male gaze of the camera, combined with the male gaze of the hero, commodifies and fetishises female characters. John Berger in <em>Ways of Seeing </em>points out that in the films, “Men act, women appear. Men look at women, women watch themselves being looked at.” The sexist and selective male gaze of the camera is focused on selective parts of the female body. Bindu Nair in her essay- “Female Bodies and the Male Gaze” explains how women are turned into a ‘spectacle’-</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“The gaze is invited to certain parts of the body selectively considered sexual &#8211; the eyes, the lips, the breasts, the navel, the buttocks and the legs…All these add up in objectifying and sexualising the body of the woman for the benefit of the (male) viewer.” </em></p><cite><em>Nair, 2009</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The famous “item songs” in our films are a great example of the male gaze at play.  The songs like ‘Tip Tip Barsa’ or ‘Fevicol Se’ show how the camera angles, the costumes, the makeup and even the actions of the female characters in these songs fetishise female body and cater to male pleasure, i.e. the pleasure of the hero and the male audience.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>This problematic depiction of women in Bollywood films translates to real life as well. The impressionable minds of youth accept this sexist and misogynistic portrayal as the norm. This could be an important reason why women in our society face a lot of backlashes if they stray from the stereotypical idea of femininity and try to assert their voice and freedom. Films borrow from reality but they also influence our reality. Therefore, in a society where films largely shape our way of thinking, we need more films with strong and independent female characters. The need of the hour is good films which tackle the rampant misogyny in our society, and not increase it by projecting stereotypical and regressive ideas of femininity. We are definitely on the path of change and progress, but we are not there yet. The Hindi Film industry is waking up to the importance of this issue, but there is still a long way to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">I happened to be on a call the other day with a very close friend of mine who’s expecting a baby soon and while having a great session of gossip she popped up the question of what I was going to send as a gift for her newborn. I immediately replied with a tone of obviousness that I must know the gender to pick a gift. Every time a couple is blessed with a beautiful child, picking a gift never seems so difficult. Why you ask? Well, a baby girl would be loaded with everything pink and a baby boy would get the same in blue. Similarly guessing a baby’s gender just by their clothes has never been a difficult task. The baby wouldn’t really care if it’s pink or blue because we are the ones who push them to feel attached to a specific colour before they can even develop the ability to choose for themselves. When I think of it, gender really has no role to play. However, it’s such an ingrained concept that even though we realise a colour doesn’t justify its <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/unlatching-the-cage-of-emotions-breaking-gender-specific-stereotypes/">forceful association</a> with a particular gender, knowingly or unknowingly we all keep up with the tradition of choosing for the baby hence promoting sexism.</p>



<h3>Origin and Trend Setting of Colour Sexism</h3>



<p>It must be noted that gender-colour stereotype and assigning a colour to gender isn’t an ancient concept but a twentieth-century trait. After World War II, blue was used extensively for <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5673081_Pink_and_blue_The_color_of_gender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men’s uniforms</a>. Therefore, blue was identified as more of a masculine colour. Since 1940, pink was promoted as a woman’s colour. “Think Pink” was the marketing slogan to convince women to embrace their femininity. It grew massively in the 1970s and by the 1980s it was a full-fledged concept where markets were captured by brands selling gender-specific merchandise to parents indoctrinating a stark contrast in their minds. Also, the introduction of clinical tests that were capable of revealing the gender of an unborn baby, in different countries, played a major role as parents had the opportunity to preplan shopping for their children and stock up on everything that would speak loud and clear for the gender. Scrolling up and down social media apps I came across a trending concept of ‘Gender Reveal’ which was first started by <a href="https://www.insider.com/woman-who-invented-gender-reveal-parties-has-mixed-feelings-2019-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Karnuvidis</a> in the year 2008. She baked a cake full of pink icing to celebrate a baby girl they were expecting. After 10 years of this viral phenomenon, she realized how the trend picked up and someone’s potential and talent should not be compartmentalized depending solely on what’s between their legs. </p>



<h3>Sexism in Toys: Not a Child’s Play</h3>



<p>With sexism being the primary focus while growing up, most children face a huge dilemma about peculiar universally accepted, gender-specific presents. Girls get a lot of Barbie dolls, kitchen sets, jewellery sets, anything and everything that’s ‘pinkified’. Boys are assumed to fancy GI Joes, Hotwheels, toy guns, for god’s sake the society loves gifting their sons a lot of weapons! It’s not just the gift that needs to be focused on but the dull mindset behind it. Gifting a kitchen set is the most suitable way to glorify what the society actually thinks of women, trying best to nurture their homely instincts because clearly, society would rather assign specific gender roles than let women dream of being bold, independent, and sore high with a mind of their own. I’ve seen parents often discouraging their boys who dare to show even the slightest of an inclination towards so-called ‘girly’ toys or makeup. This discrimination affects their thinking and behavioural pattern tremendously. The trauma of not being able to open up to your own birth givers about personal preferences, toys or choice of colours is claustrophobic in itself.</p>



<h3>Second Home</h3>



<p>We call schools our second homes and now I know why! There’s an uncanny significance between the two. A divide between girls and boys surprisingly exist in schools and educational institutions even today. We choose to ignore red flags of clear cut segregation that children commonly face on a day to day basis. For instance, boys who don’t like being a certain way and aren’t necessarily rough, rugged, crass and ‘manly’ if I must use the word are commonly subjected to a lot of bullying and are vulnerable to great deals of trauma that follows. This not only creates a problem for the child but also breaks their self-esteem. Yes, schools are very thoughtful and progressive about holding menstrual awareness workshops. Sadly these are strictly girl-specific and therefore boys are not just unaware of how a woman&#8217;s body functions but also made negligent about menstruation in general. Which is why the role of men in menstruation is still vague and sanitary pads continue to be sold wrapped in newspapers or black plastics. Girls are also taught to not speak about menstruation openly or involve the opposite gender because it doesn’t speak well of how ‘cultured’ they are. Sensitizing children about natural, biological phenomenon like these is a necessity and we need to acknowledge it as a society that&#8217;s concerned for the future generation.</p>



<h3>‘Gender’ or ‘Sex’</h3>



<p>Biology also teaches us the difference between a boy and a girl but what we&#8217;re often not taught is the concept of behaviour. Sexism forces one to behave in a set way. When we get behaviour into the picture let me tell you ‘Gender’ and ‘Sex’ are two very different terms. However, we end up using them interchangeably. During the second year of under-graduation, I took up Educational Psychology as an elective. While exploring certain topics I happened to come across a study which explained how humans are born as male or female biologically but socially, culturally and personally they might associate themselves as more masculine or feminine by nature. This masculinity or femininity is controlled by the society and anything that doesn’t seem to fit into their social construct is termed as abnormal and looked down upon. When a boy or a man places himself on the pink side of the spectrum we associate his gender or sexual identity with that of a woman and assume they’re homosexual. A lot of homophobics repel men who wear pink. Pink, thus in this scenario is seen as a badge of shame because it’s socially unacceptable for men to be inclined towards a colour like Pink because it’s assumed to be a colour for those who are soft, weak and feminine and men don’t gain social acceptance if they fall under such categories.</p>

<p>Fun fact, during 1930-1940, Nazi concentration camp badges included a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_badge#Table_of_camp_inmate_markings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pink triangle</a>&nbsp;for gay men, while lesbians were lumped into an ‘asocial elements’ group with a black triangle. This shows the relevance of pink to femininity. However, in the late 60s, with the articulation of the LGBT rights movement, the significance of pink began a shift from shame to pride. The ‘Queer’ Community still struggles for acceptance because these factors are so deep-rooted.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Live and Let Live</h3>



<p>I’m sure if you’re a boy you must be able to relate to sentences like ‘don’t cry like a girl’ or ‘boys don’t cry because crying is for the weak’ and if you’re a girl you might’ve come across sentences like ‘sit like a girl, talk softly like a girl’ a zillion times! We need to get our basics right and realise that it is every human’s right to choose what they feel is best for themselves, associate or dissociate with people, colours, art forms or ideologies. Especially babies shouldn’t be pushed towards something purposely, taking advantage of their age and their inability to form an opinion or even understand what likes and dislikes are. This cycle of unnecessary pressure and dominance also has to stop. There should be absolute freedom in order to keep diversity alive. Diversity nowadays is probably best defined in an LGBTQ rainbow flag which is symbolic of an all-inclusive society. We should learn to live and let live instead of assigning particular colours and laying expectations on toddlers to stay true to them. There should be absolute freedom of picking any colour at any age, making it your own, and possessing the liberty to change it too because let&#8217;s face it, we&#8217;re much more than the X and Y chromosomes that we limit ourselves to!</p>
