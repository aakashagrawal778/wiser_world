<p>K-pop, the popular music that originated in South Korea is taking over the whole world with the raging popularity of K-pop groups like BTS, Black Pink, GOT7, Monsta X, and many more. The whole K-pop idea was introduced as a distinct traineeship modal in the South Korean music industry which is now followed by the rest of the entertainment industry. The growing popularity of the K-pop industry is not only promoting the Korean culture over the world, even into countries like Chile, Afghanistan, and Middle East but is also making a strong impact on the <a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/decoding-south-koreas-economy/">South Korean economy</a>. The way this industry is growing, K-pop is sure to propel the South Korean economy in the years ahead.</p>



<p>So, the whole concept of K-pop dominance all over the world is known as “<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/bts-tops-billboard-100-list-how-k-pop-helped-korea-improve-its-economy/articleshow/65266543.cms">Hallyu</a>”, a Chinese word that stands for the Korean wave of pop culture. The continuous growth of Hallyu resulted in increased distribution and consumption of Korean content through platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and SNS. Even the incredible and first-ever success of director Bong Joon-Ho’s film <em>Parasite</em> also helped in Hallyu content and the Korean film/entertainment in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>A Little Into Hallyu Background and Present State</strong></h2>



<p>In 1992, the Korean Culture and Tourism Institute send a copy of a drama to play into the other countries, with the support of the South Korean government. The government helps these industries to go and other things also. The projects that helped in the spread of Hallyu are – boys over flower, my seesy girl, Swiri, Autumn in my heart also the songs SHINee&#8217;s ring ding ding, PSY Gangnam Style, Rain’s bad boy. These become popular not only in the parts of Asia but also among the youth of other countries like the US and the UK. When it comes to Hallyu there are five main factors one shouldn&#8217;t forget. The impact starts with lifting the ban on foreign travel for Korean citizens, along with Korean chaebols restructuring. Samsung also considers another main factor of the Korean wave. The rise of Samsung was another era for the South Korean economy and Hallyu. Branding of Korean companies and banning censorship lows, giving opportunities to other citizens to come and learn K-pop is another highlight of the K-pop era. As Barak Obama <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2199-8531/3/4/22/pdf">said </a>the entertainment industry of K-pop in South Korea is the government’s priority.</p>



<p>Every Korean brand promotes its ad along with a K-pop idol or actor, which helps when the protagonist of the ad goes overseas, they help the brand to promote overseas. The wave of Korean pop culture has great support from the government from the past. Korean pop culture has a great impact on Asian countries like China, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. The Hallyu itself a mandarin word. The K-pop industry is joined by trainees from China, Thailand, and Japan. Many of K-pop group consists of Chinese, Thai and Japanese members along with Korean members with their nationality abroad, which helps them to gain popularity among the countries and reach achievements. Many Korean idols, singers, actors have also signed many sub-labels in other countries due to the increase of Hallyu. The rising popularity of the entertainment industries not only promoting Hallyu but also giving a high rise to the Korean government.&nbsp; The growth of the Korean wave over the last two decades is fantastic and giving a major impact on the Korean economy. </p>



<h2><strong>K-popnomy</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to the K-pop music industry, five to eight K-pop music labels are offering a huge range in the Korean economy. Such labels are Big Hit Entertainment, SM Entertainment, JYP Official, Starship Official, and many more. The chairman of SM Entertainment, Lee Soo-man told a recent seminar that he believed k- pop would grow through technological innovation and even Hallyu celebrities in all powered avatars could even become part of our lives. According to Korea foundation president Lee gum, Hallyu has not only become a global content but an asset to South Korea’s pubic diplomacy. CNN published the article with the headline after the sudden popularity of K-pop song Gangnam Style by PSY released in 2012, “Korean wave of pop culture swipes across Asia.”</p>



<p>Being the uppermost country with the determined goal to become the most popular culture leading exporter South Korea along with its government supporting the entertainment industries to grow higher and reach audiences all over the world. Also, we can say it’s the way to develop the soft power of the country. With the blessing of the biggest cultural phenomena across Asia and another part of the globe Hallyu, Korea expands its businesses, culture, and country image.</p>

<p>Korean merchandise exports to a country respond strongly to lagged TV program exports to the same destination but mostly in sectors characterized by consumer products. These include UN Broad Economic Categories like food and beverages, and other consumer goods Korean annual exports reports, Korean products such as cosmetics, food, fashion, electronics, and mobile phones are exports at a higher rate, which helped in raising the bar by 34.7%. The exports also include the merch by the K-pop idols, groups, the brand product they used to promote also exports at a high rate. Such change of consumer preferences has occurred through several ways as supported by numerous survey results and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200309-the-soft-power-roots-of-k-pop">reports </a>by the MoFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), KOTRA (Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency), and KOFICE (Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange).</p>



<p>First, foreign consumers form favorable national images of Korea while watching the dramas as they naturally experience a chance to learn and appreciate the Korean culture. In the past, people tend to associate national images of South Korea negatively with the Korean War or North Korea, but nowadays such images are giving way to the charming, fun, and lively images of entertainments and state-of-the-art technologies. Such a change of national image enhances consumer preferences for products with the “Made in Korea” label. The entertainment industry helps in the economy by their image, ad, and role in the different brands and also promoting the tourist view of South Korea.</p>



<p>Along with the South Korean government promoting Hallyu the K-pop being the most strong soft power to the country making South Korea a destination of investment and commercial zone for many businesses all over the world. The massive popularity, immense government support, and running television station, broadcasting station helping the K-pop industry to provide a stable and strong economy to the South Korean even in the time of Covid-19.</p>



<h2>K-pop Boyband <strong>BTS&#8217;s Impact on the South Korean Economy</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min-1024x682.jpeg" alt="K-pop Boyband BTS's Impact on the South Korean Economy" class="wp-image-4166" width="563" height="375" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min-768x512.jpeg 768w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min-1170x780.jpeg 1170w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-19-at-7.14.38-PM-min.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /><figcaption>Image Credits: BigHit Labels/Twitter</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><strong>Japanese Imperialism and Annexation of Korea: 1905</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24761028.2020.1762300" rel="sponsored nofollow">strategic importance </a>of the Korean Peninsula has enacted as the bridge between Asia mainland and Japan. It was believed that dominance over the Korean Peninsula signified influence over East Asia. It was during 1876 that diplomatic ties between both the countries were established. The Sino- Japanese War fought during 1894- 1895 must be analyzed from the perspective of Japanese imperialism or ‘Empire of the East’ countering the notion of western imperialism. However, the latter is not the only form of imperialism. Clearly, the aim of the Japanese government was to exercise political and economic control. Public opinion supported this action and clearly believed that Japan should play a pivotal role in helping Korea to free itself from the clutches of China. On the other hand, Qing China during the 1880s espoused the necessity to dominate over Korea. It is indeed true that nationalism and the trajectory of civilization have an intimate relationship as can be clearly seen by the case of Japan. Both the countries emphasized on their narratives to point out the righteousness in their actions (Sook, 2011, p: 39-74). Clearly, the Japanese government had manipulated the public opinion towards its aggressive foreign policy. Japan engaged in the discourse of civilization or bunmei kaika to present itself as a progressive nation which saw the light of Westernization (Darua, 2001, p: 99- 130). This altering contour emerged during the reign of the Meiji Restoration (1868-1912).&nbsp; However, Russia’s emergence as a threat to Japan pushed the latter to be protective about Korea which led to the Russo-Japan War in 1905.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Colonization of Korea (1905- 1945): Etched in Korea’s Collective Memory</strong></h3>



<p>Russia’s defeat was the stepping stone for Japan as Korea was formally annexed and become a part of the Japanese empire in 1905. Korea remained colonized till 1945 after which she was freed from Japan’s clutches with the latter’s defeat in the Pacific War. It was in 1912 that the Japanese Governor-General propagated laws that allowed the Japanese people to have ownership of land in Korea. A resettlement program was introduced by the government wherein many Japanese families settled in Korea before the end of the First World War. A large scale displacement took place. Additionally, 724,777 Korean workers had been sent to mainland Japan and Sakhalin as labourers in industries for mining, shipbuilding and construction. The Koreans were treated as second-class citizens and the Japanese government attempted to erase their culture by drawing up policies that would lead them to speak in the language of the colonizers. It was believed that Korean history and geography books were burned down by a nationwide search as well as confiscation of books of its independence and biographies of its national heroes was conducted by the government.</p>



<p>Not only that, gender-based violence on the Korean women was emerging as a disturbing issue during the Second World War. 20,000 Korean and Asian women were trafficked in military brothels to serve as ‘comfort women’ to the Japanese soldiers during the Asia-Pacific war. Comfort stations had been established in Indonesia, Indochina, Thailand, Okinawa, Korea and Taiwan. The women were treated as forced sexual slaves and must be analyzed from the perspective of gender-based violence. On the other hand, Japan had been the signatory of the International Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children of 1921, yet Korea and Taiwan did not come under its purview. (Min, 2003, p: 938-957) The terminology of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14672715.1994.10416165"><em>jugun inafu</em></a> or comfort women was coined by the Japanese Government officials to cloak the reality of sexual slavery. Women who rebelled were brutally beaten up, raped and tortured.&nbsp; It took 20 years before the former Korean President, Park Chung- Hee had agreed to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49330531">normalize ties</a> with Japan as collective memory etched on to its horrifying history.</p>



<h3><strong>Changing Contour of Republic of Korea and Japan Ties</strong></h3>



<p>The<a href="https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2019C35_skk.pdf"> relations </a>between South Korea and Japan can be examined from the point of view of a former suzerain state and colonizer since the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Japan had argued that by the <a href="https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=16369&amp;context=rtd">treaty </a>of 1965 with South Korea, the former has provided compensation of $9.5 million for its sexual slavery as well as apologized in 1993. It was in 1952 that the first territorial dispute emerged between South Korea and Japan. Although Tokyo came under the jurisdiction of Korea, it had been administered by the latter for 41 years.&nbsp; Kim Young- Sum’s Government declared the construction of a wharf facility in 1996 which was protested by the Hashimoto Government of Japan. However, on the face of North- Korean Teapeo- Dong Missile Crisis, Republic of Korea, President Kim and Japanese Prime Minister, Obuchi in 1998 signed the Joint Declaration and Action for a New Korea- Japan partnership in the 21st century. It was in 2015 that the former Foreign Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida offered a formal apology and the Japanese Government stated that it would establish a Reconciliation and Healing Center which would care for the victims of sexual violence.&nbsp; As Korea was in the process of democratization, civic organizations such as the Association of War Victims and Bereaved Families of Korean’s and Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice insisted that their Government must bring out a resolution to the colonial problems faced in South Korea. However, it cannot be denied that Japan was heralded as an economic partner. The post- Cold War period witnessed shifts in Korea- Japan relationship as security cooperation between USSR, North Korea, China and on the other hand, Japan, Republic of Korea and the USA broke down. Nonetheless, it cannot be forgotten that Japan and South Korea have espoused an anti-community narrative which is significant in their alliance as constructivism argues. These countries distinguish themselves from the other or Communism in this regard which is rooted in the perception of the self and other. The alliance is established when North Korea emerges as a common threat that leads them to shift from friction. It is imperative that the norms or a common ground must be shared for cooperation to flourish. Adding to that, the alliance did not last very long when in 2010 South Korea recalled the ambassador to Tokyo to protest against the approval of the Japanese Government of middle school textbooks written by the Society for Making New History Books, a Right- Wing intellectual group that aimed to conceal the atrocities of Japan’s wartime history. (Cho, 2008, p: 2-117) It clearly glorified Japanese militarism and fueled anti- Japanese sentiment in Korean public opinion. South Korean domestic policies have the impact of post-colonial history. The<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/22/c_138575908.htm"> General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA)</a> had been signed in 2016 which allowed Seoul and Japan to exchange information on North Korean missile which was supposed to expire in November. Ties experienced a downward spiral after the Supreme Court of South Korea in 2018 had <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49330531">ordered </a>Japanese Firms to pay reparation for mobilizing Korean men and women as forced labours. Japan <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/22/c_138575908.htm">responded </a>in July by removing South Korea from its list of trading partners as well as curbing exports namely fluorinated polyamides, photerists and hydrogen fluoride which are pivotal to the former’s semiconductor industry. The decision of not renewing the GSOMIA was upheld by Moon Jae’s government. The trade war that had been declared by both the countries has been perceived as a warning sign for USA and fear looms of the trilateral alliance breaking down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Portrayal of Japanese Media House Towards the Issue of Comfort Women</strong></h3>



<p>Journalism plays a pivotal role in bringing the truth to the public, yet this is determined by the coverage of the issue and if its portrayal is influenced by Government representation. ‘Sorrowful Homecoming’ was a Documentary which was released by the Korea Center of Investigative Journalism in 2016 that contained interviews of Korean women who were treated as sex slaves. This documentary had been created to raise awareness of the brutality done by the Japanese Imperial Army on Korean women and reconstruct the past <a href="http://www.e-asianwomen.org/xml/11617/11617.pdf">human abuses</a>. This has played an important role in building the collective memory of South Korea. &nbsp;(Runquist, 2020, p: 2-17) On the other hand, Hirayasu Minzo, the Executive Editor of the Japan Times had <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-politics-newsroom-insight/fear-and-favour-chill-newsroom-at-storied-japanese-paper-idINKCN1PI37G">criticized </a>Reuters for not taking into account Japan’s viewpoint of colonization and refused to call comfort women as victims neither did he view Japan’s annexation of Korea as brutal.&nbsp; Clearly, the Japan Times had refused to portray the horrifying Human Rights Violations that had occurred under the Meji regime in fear that it would be perceived as anti- Japanese by Shinzo Abe’s Government as it needed revenues from companies to survive and therefore had utilized the usage of such terminology. Although, Minzo had denied that his stance had altered due to external pressure, the fear of Abe’s Government ceasing the functioning of the paper could be viewed as one of the motives behind such an action. Indeed, the banner was, “All the news without fear or favor” has proved to be a farce as the truth has been denied. This has played a pivotal role in accentuating differences between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>USA’s Role in South Korea-Japan Ties</strong></h3>



<p>The USA had <a href="https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/us-south-korea-relations-1945">perceived </a>South Korea as its bulwark against Communism during the Cold War era. Yet, it cannot be denied that she built the foundation for democracy and it was the path that the Republic of Korea walked on. It was in 1953 that the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10165.pdf">Mutual Defense Treaty</a> between the USA and the ROK was signed when Korean War had come to an end. The fervour to <a href="https://www.nbr.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/publications/special_report_59_trilateralism_july2016.pdf">renew </a>this alliance was pushed by George Bush’s Government during the 2000s. The USA, Japan and the Republic of Korea have been entangled in<a href="https://www.nbr.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/publications/special_report_59_trilateralism_july2016.pdf"> trilateral cooperation</a> as North Korea’s advancement of nuclear missiles and China’s growing aggressiveness have led to the development of this alliance as these three countries share the standpoint of security. Nevertheless, this alliance has been embedded in the USA’s foreign policy. Nonetheless, an <a href="https://www.nbr.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/publications/special_report_59_trilateralism_july2016.pdf">agreement </a>between the Korean President, Park Geun- Hye and Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe was reached on 28<sup>th</sup> December 2015 which could not have been possible without the pivotal role played by Obama’s administration which focused on the policy of “Rebalance to Asia”.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>It is imperative for the Trump administration to sustain the trilateral cooperation as the ties between The ROK and Japan experience significant shifts due to the disturbing colonial past and atrocities embedded in the history of South Korea. As China’s aggressiveness becomes a warning sign for the USA as the ever so globalized world witnesses a re-emerging dawning Cold War era, the alliance can become the foundation for resistance if the economic partnership is facilitated. However, it must be kept in mind that the relationship of the Republic of Korea with Japan has been defined by the history of colonialism and collective memory.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Korean War from 1950 to 1953 had devastating effects on the population of both the nations due to their hostile division. Families were torn apart with no form of communication and left South Korea in a state of poverty. While this impact in itself was colossal, South Korea had the added burden of not being left with any natural resources to revive their economy. This, therefore, led to South Korea being an underdeveloped economy, completely reliant on its agrarian produce and foreign aid from the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The South Korean economic model, also known as the Miracle of the Han River refers to the rapid economic growth in South Korea after the Korean War. In less than two decades South Korea saw a pragmatic shift in their economy and is currently the 12th largest economy in the world according to its GDP.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gKlXLvIyw5ADXY72MgYKrY59j_7mk6XNUKs4ZwN1sQA1HCX4X0hZo0IJe1Lv-3QuUQzN90OOus9UysHcZv04ZI6xNyc9G5o3yi92dxxCxwyUZLlAC_PiHp45JUct5B5b_h3C0mbf" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>This heightening of South Korea’s economy can be factored by 3 principal factors:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Investments in rebuilding an education system and innovations</li><li>Eliminating an agrarian economy</li><li>Withholding dynastical mega corporations&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Prior to the Second World War and the Korean War, South Korea had the foundation laid for a vocational training system. However, this was disrupted by the aftermath of the wars and completely shattered their system. Resultantly, the government started focussing on rebuilding their educational and vocational training system with the sole purpose of increasing employment which would have the dual benefits of eliminating poverty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation started with compulsory school attendance from ages 6 to 15 and in the 1970’s South Korea set an equalisation policy which aimed at reducing competition to get into prestigious secondary schools. In “equalisation zones” students were taken into consideration for a prestigious secondary education by a lottery system. Although many parents were opposed to this idea since these students were not admitted on the basis of merit, this policy-induced parents from equalisation zones, which were primarily regions that were less developed, to send their children to school and fulfill the minimum requirements to be eligible for this policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A significant chunk of South Korea’s economic restoration post the war is attributed to the willingness of citizens to enroll themselves into the educational system while also having the flexibility to opt for vocational training after secondary education. This was made possible by the government&#8217;s investment in human capital which promoted innovation and developed a good workforce for the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings the model to its second aim of eliminating an agriculture and cultivation based economy. South Korea started focusing on industrialising its rural areas and bringing them out of the realm of subsistence farming. This happened as a result of increased literacy rates and investments in infant industries by the government which led to more job opportunities. Hence, bringing citizens out of villages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to investments in building human capital, South Korean ties with the US majorly helped the country in picking up its pace as far as investments in infant industries are concerned. During the Vietnam War, South Korea contributed by providing troops to the US military. In return America harboured trade ties with South Korea which increased the cash flow into the country, hence, increasing the government&#8217;s revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After achieving the first two goals of its plan, the South Korean government was now in a position to carry out mass production, at a globalised level. However, Japan was already a regional supplier of electronics, automobiles and technological gadgets, all of which Korea had expertise in. This initially made it challenging for South Korea to gain an edge over the Japanese suppliers. Gradually, due to Japan’s spurge of development, the costs increased which therefore helped South Korea gain a comparative advantage in the aspect of supplying cheaper produce on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this plan resulting in continued growth of the South Korean economy, the government now moved to its third aim of the economic model. This aim consisted of sustaining the progress and the firms involved in the growth of the country. The government started backing “Chaebols” which refers to family-run businesses that are passed on and run within the family. In the late ‘70s, the government realised the rate at which these companies were growing and assured support by ensuring a cash flow from the government&#8217;s side and urged the firms to focus on growing. Today these family dynasties have become mega-monopolistic corporations, run namely by Samsung, LG and Hyundai. These three companies alone are responsible for 2/3rd’s of the entire Korean economy and produce for the three main industries of the country- ship manufacturing, automobiles and electronics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst this strategy to make the economy reliant on just three major corporations has turned out to be extremely lucrative for South Korea but it has now become too big to fail. This essentially means that in case of an economic crash or an obstruction in the mechanism of any of these companies, thousands of people will lose their jobs, stocks will fall and the economy will most likely experience a recession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic gaining momentum globally, the South Korean economy, like many others, faced a recession and saw a fall in their GDP for the first time in 17 years. Nonetheless, the South Korean Finance Minister is optimistic that the nation will be back on track by the third quarter much like China. Since South Korea does not have a geographical terrain as large as China and the natural resources, the government will have to continue their already undertaken policies of fostering education and innovation to revive its economy once again.&nbsp;</p>
