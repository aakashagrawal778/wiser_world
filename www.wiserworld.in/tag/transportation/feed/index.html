<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">Since the beginning of mankind, humans asserted largely over finding better modes of transportation to improve their experience and it could also save a large amount of time. Due to this many inventions took place; until the Wright Brothers developed the world&#8217;s first successful motor-operated airplane. Now, we can also see drones or UAVs working on the same technology.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is a link between a train and an airplane because its shape resembles a train while its projected speed is similar to that of an aeroplane. It is the most recent approach in the field of passenger and goods transportation proposed by the CEO and owner of Space X, Elon Musk.</p>



<h3><strong>Explaination and Detailed Study</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size">The concept of Hyperloop consists of a sealed tube or connection of tubes with low air pressure in which a pod can travel in the absence of friction and air resistance. This was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-hyper-loop-2012-9?IR=T">proposed </a>by Elon Musk in 2012. His initial research and planning constituted reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules travel in air bearings driven by a linear induction motor and axial compressors. This project was open-sourced for individuals and other private ventures. Currently, the Mumbair-Pune corridor is officially researching this concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div></div>



<h3><strong>Theory based on Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop concept relies largely on the reduction of friction and air resistance which implies that one needs to create a vacuum inside the sealed tube so that fast propagation would take place, but we also know creating a complete vacuum inside a free space is nearly impossible. Hyperloop is a vactrain system with a pressure of 100 pascals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2477" width="487" height="324" srcset="http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1.png 600w, http://www.wiserworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyperloop_diagram_based_on_design_by_Elon_Musk-1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption><em>Hyperloop diagram based on design by Elon Musk</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For the propagation, the shape and size of the pod matters a lot and especially if we are moving inside a tunnel-like tube. According to the original concept put forward by Elon Musk the capsule or pods will float (0.5-1.3 mm) layer of air beneath it.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The pressure to “skis”. Another hyperloop technology involves <strong>Maglev. </strong>Maglev is a system of train transportation using two sets of magnets. One to push the train off the track and another to pull it forward.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The linear induction motors&nbsp;located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the required speed and this will vary for each section of the tube route. In the earlier hyperloop concept conceptualised by Elon Musk an electric driven fan or inlet fan is attached in    front of capsule like the axial compressor in older aeroplanes.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Talking about the shape, the proposed design of the hyperloop is 7ft 4 inches in diameter, and the projected speed of the same is 1220km/hr, maintaining aero-dynamic efficiency, which is much greater than a passanger aeroplane which moves with the highest speed of 930 km/hr.</p>



<h3><strong>Constructional Research on Capsules</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is built by a new type of carbon fibre composite which is eight times stronger than aluminium and ten times than steel accessories. It is also much less in weight about 1.5 times less heavy than aluminium, this composite is named as “<strong><em>Vibranium</em></strong>” based on the 2018 hollywood movie <strong>Black Panther</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The pods will be prepared using two layers of Vibranium one for the inside and other for the outside layers of hyperloop capsule.</p>



<h3><strong>Fuel based Research on Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop is better than air passenger transport and high-speed rails because it rarely produces any noise and is environmental-friendly. No green house gases are released in this process making it a better and more sustainable mode of transport.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The modern-day hyperloops are electric, they are similar to electric cars. With hyperloop, we eliminate sources, like wheels on a track, and we actually have a sound barrier inherent in our tube design. There is no chance of noise and air pollution and thus there are no health adversities.</p>



<h3><strong>Cost Estimation and Expenses of Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The constructional cost by Hyperloop one was estimated to be somewhere between 19 to 20 billion Euros or 22 billion USD according to 2016, there might be variation in prices today. Also, there will be a variation in expenses as hyperloop will be more expensive than aeroplane, all because of creation of vacuum needs large and expensive machines and the carbon synthesis material is hard to prepare.</p>



<h3><strong>Technologies Associated to Hyperloop</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There are many technologies associated to hyperloop and works similarly, which includes Swiss Metro, SG Maglev; that has devised a train in Japan which does not need vacuum tubes and run with the speed of 630 km/hr, which is also the fastest train in the world and it is designed using aerodynamic shape. The major challenge in the success of hyperloop is the already running trains with such a high speed. Though Hyperloop is in its development phase, we can witness its speed which is estimated using a partial vacuum model as creating a complete vacuum is a myth until someone makes it possible.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;In 2015 Space-X announced its competition, in which more than 700 teams participated in the event and showcased their innovation of pod designs, material and most importantly safety implications which are still not resolved, because of which many people criticize this very idea of Hyperloop.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Another event took place which also acted as a competition of speed and Technical University of Munich won the contest with a speed of 324-330 km/hr.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">But in the third competition which took place in 2018 with proper safety precautions, the Technical University of Munich recreated a record by beating their previous record, this time the highest attained speed was 463 km/hr.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">But still problem remained the same Hyperloop is much behind the Shanghai Maglev or SG Maglev.</p>



<h3><strong>Countries Initiating Hyperloop Projects</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Countries have deep interests in developing this project. Major initiatives have been taken by major superpowers like the USA where this project was first started. Many institutes and private companies are researching on this project in order to finish this project and accomplish the assigned speed of 1220 km/hr, countries like China are researching for trains similar to hyperloop.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">While Japan is searching for faster maglev trains using the same technology. Hyperloop project is also attaining speed in Dubai and India.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hyperloop Transporting Technology will start its human trials in 2020 by completing its pod or capsule development. For now, only a few people can travel using this technology.</p>



<h3><strong>India&#8217;s Approach</strong> <strong>and Projects on Hyperloop</strong></h3>

</div></div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">India is the only country that is officially pertaining to hyperloop technology for <strong>Mumbai-Pune corridors</strong>. The Hyperloop project will be based on the ‘Swiss Challenge Method’. This project will be done in association with Virgin Hyperloop One.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Amongst many grounded projects <strong>Amaravati via Vijayawada</strong> is also one of them it was proposed by Government of Andhra Pradesh and it was done in association with HTT USA.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;The US based company did all the surveys and planned for appropriate capsules and the 700 km was setup by which this loop line could have connected <strong>Anantapur, Vijayawada, Amravati, Vizag</strong> but all this changed and project stopped after the election and ruling party changed.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Delhi via Mumbai</strong> connecting<strong> Jaipur </strong>and<strong> Indore</strong> is also amongst the incomplete projects due to lack of interest by the government because of the other ongoing issues. This project was set forward by DGW Hyperloop, Indore. This loop is 1317 km long, and it claims to cover the distance between Mumbai and Delhi in just 80 mins that’s hard to believe but it is true as the company had already done all its trials.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Amritsar via Chandigarh </strong>connecting <strong>Ludhiana</strong> was proposed in August 2019 and is in progress, this project was sanctioned at the cost of Rs 56,000 crore. This project is stopped due to nationwide lockdown. Virgin Hyperloop One which is the most recent HT claims that distance between two cities can be summarised from 5 hours to mere 30 min. This loop was decided to be 232km in length.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Amongst all these projects the best project is <strong>Mumbai to Pune project </strong>Virgin Hyperloop One was all set with its planning and <strong>Devendra Fradnavis </strong>then C.M. of Maharashtra initiated this project and this project was assigned to Pune Metropolitan Development Authority, this was made with an initiative to reduce time of travelling from 3 hours to 20 mins. This project was successful as Virgin Hyperloop and DP World together invested $ 500 million, but all this changed when the Devendra Fadnavis government was replaced with the present coalition government led by Uddhav Thackrey.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Hyperloop and Future of Pods and Tubes</strong></h3>



<p>Hyperloop is better than any other land or track transport because it essentially does not release any harmful gases or chemicals into the environment and by adding little more speed it can become the fastest means of transportation. It may be more expensive than air transport but is safer because there is a specified area designed for its propagation while aeroplane and helicopter are riskier as they fly freely in the open air.</p>



<p>The future of pods indicates to redesigning of the pods so that the desired speed could be attained and tubes need to be aligned at the fixed angle so that there is no chance of accidents.</p>



<p>The hardest and the most dreadful task is to create vacuum so that high speed propagation of capsules can be done, which needs to be rectified.</p>



<p>We will surely witness the advancement in this field in the near future as no one could assure the confirm completion of this project which is seemingly futuristic.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Speed enhancement is the major factor in development of HLTT.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The speed of Hyperloop is increasing slowly and gradually and the breakthrough in the same could be achieved if we are able to achieve the vacuum state where there is no air, but it also poses risk of alignment and directions because slight variation in the same could lead to accidents although magnet protects them from getting out of their way and thus they remain over the track.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In an augmented form development of the hyperloop, it seems like a difficult task, but it is not impossible at the same time.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In short, this development is a revolutionary approach and will add greater value to our present day transportation facilities.</p>
