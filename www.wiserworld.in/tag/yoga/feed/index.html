										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">According to <strong>the World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>, around <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/767524/over-300-million-people-are-affected-by-depression.html"><strong>300 million</strong></a><strong> </strong>people all over the world have been affected due to depression.<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-74ede2e9-b178-474a-8ba1-d00fa4a8a2b8"></mark> It basically leads to sadness and can make an individual both mentally and physically weak. <mark>It is an illness and a medical disorder that affects the behaviour of a person which can be observed through behavioural changes.</mark> It can also affect the different systems of the body, mainly the immune system, and can disrupt their sleep pattern (insomnia) or can conduce early awakening in the morning or can be accompanied by anxiety.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In India, as reported by the <strong>National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16</strong>, nearly <strong>15%</strong> of Indian adults require interceding for mental health issues and at least one in twenty Indians suffer from depression. According to the recent WHO report India is the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/india-is-the-6th-most-depressed-country-who-report/articleshow/66179026.cms"><strong>6<sup>th</sup> most depressed</strong></a> country with 258,000 reported suicides in the year 2012. The report also mentions that around 80% of Indians don’t seek treatment after getting diagnosed with depression, mostly because of the stigmatization of mental health in Indian society.</p>



<h4><strong>Reasons for Depression:</strong></h4>



<ul><li> Hormonal changes in the brain of a human being.</li><li>A person who always thinks negatively or perceives the conditions with a pessimist approach more likely faces stress loneliness and anxiety.</li><li>Some people who constantly experience violence, hatred, abuse, poverty, and relationship disputes easily tend to fall in depression.</li><li>Sometimes genetics plays a major role in making a person vulnerable to depression as it runs from the parents to their children and affects them without external causes.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Symptoms of Depression:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Fluctuating body weight</li><li>Energy loss or fatigue</li><li>Feeling irritated or agitated</li><li>Finding oneself guilty and worthless</li><li>The feeling of being left out</li><li>Reduced concentration power</li><li>Lowering interest and pleasure in activities and works.</li><li>Suicidal thoughts or constant thoughts about self-harm</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Present Scenario</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Normally, people in the midst of lockdown have confined themselves in their houses which might be necessary for the amelioration of the nation but when it comes to the mental health of an individual, without any medical treatments or personal measures being taken many people are going through major repercussions like <strong>depression, anxiety, frustration, fear, etc</strong>. and these sort of feelings within a person has resulted in the upsurge of activities like <strong>domestic violence and suicide attempts</strong>. Usually, people tend to find solutions for such problems through an intense consumption of alcohol and drugs but improper awareness, the looming threat of a pandemic, fear of joblessness, and lack of medical facilities available in hospitals have caused amplification of this issue.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Confirming to the <strong>Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</strong>, India requires around <strong>13,000</strong> psychiatrists. An ideal ratio to be attained is <strong>1</strong> psychiatrist for<strong> 8000</strong> patients but at present, we have <strong>3500 </strong>psychiatrists which are about <strong>1</strong> for <strong>2 lakh or 200,000 </strong>people. Regarding clinical psychologists, we need <strong>20,000 </strong>but we have only <strong>1000</strong> working clinical <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/we-need-more-mental-health-care-professionals-in-india/articleshow/66146320.cms">psychologists</a>. Though we are doing much well in the manufacturing, supply, and export of PPE kits yet it’s a need of the hour to fill this gap between the patients and the doctors required for mental health treatments by the government.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Social media has become an alternative way of living a life for us where due to loneliness people have presumed social networking sites as a second world. We have already witnessed cases of suicides due to a lesser number of likes and public views on social media handles of a person. Current so-called modern communication tools have resulted in remoteness from personal/physical engagements and gatherings.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Due to lockdown, we have started utilizing video calling tools that are leading towards a virtual life rather than a real one. Though it must be helping us in the continuation of our regular schedules it has now led to such disorders and has started affecting humans both mentally as well as physically. A human is called a <strong>social being</strong> but soon this sentence will reverberate as a fantasy and unfortunately, in the end, these social beings will find themselves as introverts.</p>



<h3><strong>Medical Treatments and Therapies for Depression</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is one of the most lethal disorders, it can be treated which must be done as soon as the illness gets diagnosed. The general method for getting it treated is with <strong>medications</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.wiserworld.in/psychological-disorder-girl-with-borderline-personality-disorder/">psychotherapy </a></strong>or with the combination of both. When these solutions don’t work <strong>electroconvulsive therapy</strong> and <strong>brain stimulation therapies</strong> are the options that are mostly explored.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Considering the medications, <strong>anti-depressants</strong> are the most recommended medicines to treat depression which may improve the brain’s way of using certain chemicals that manages the mood and stress of an individual. They may usually take <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> to<s> </s>deliver some positive results. Such kinds of prescriptions should never be taken without the counsel of a trusted doctor because an over-dosage or mistakes in the courses of intake of an antidepressant can cause serious side effects.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is another option which is also termed as <strong>‘talk therapy’</strong> or <strong>‘counselling’</strong>. It can help to reduce the symptoms of depression. Methods such as <strong>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</strong>, <strong>cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving therapy</strong> are the approaches for the treatment of depression.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If the above mentioned medical treatments don’t give expected results then <strong>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong> plays a major role in the treatment of depression. The treatment includes continuous sessions which may be thrice a week for almost two to four weeks but may cause few side effects like confusion or memory loss. However, now due to the advancement in the method of ECT, it has become safer and more effective for the patients. The procedure though is not painful and a patient is put under anaesthesia. There are many more methods to treat this mental disorder which are being studied by the researchers and the doctors and soon may be utilized for the better and more accurate treatment of the illness.</p>



<h3><strong>Yoga to Overcome Depression</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Yoga alone should never be considered as a treatment for depression but should complement with proper medication and other options after proper consultation with the doctors. Regular yoga will definitely help a person to overcome stress and will give strength to think optimistically and makes a person optimistic. Yoga includes asanas, pranayamas, and also yoga philosophies.</p>



<h4><strong>Yoga Asanas</strong>:</h4>

<h4><strong>Pranayamas to relieve anxiety:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Kapal Bhati Pranayama</li><li>Nadi Shodha Pranayama</li><li>Bhastrika Pranayama</li><li>Bhramari Pranayama</li></ul>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">These pranayamas are done by focusing or putting attention on the breath to relax and free the mind and erase thoughts that procreates anxiety or depression.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>Meditation</strong> is the method that should be followed daily because when a person gets too anxious regarding a threat or for varied reasons the muscles of a body get tense and the body starts sweating and scientific research has proven that meditation can significantly reduce the level of stress hormones.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The ancient <strong>yoga philosophies</strong> mention about two important principles of yoga, <strong>‘yamas’</strong> and <strong>‘niyamas’</strong>. According to this principle, niyama teaches about the value of containment whereas the <strong>Aprigraha</strong> principle guides us in overcoming greediness which has always remained a reason for anxiety. Another principle called the <strong>Shahucha</strong> principle glorifies the cleanliness of the body and mind. These principles also mention healthy eating habits and a proper lifestyle for a perfect livelihood.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Lastly, praying to the god and keeping positive group of company around ourselves can keep our faces smiling and can breed peace and joy in our lives.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The recent <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/actor-sushant-singh-rajput-commits-suicide-11592125887418.html">committing of suicide</a> by a well-known actor <strong>Sushant Singh Rajput</strong> has left us astonished and where <strong>depression</strong> is said to be the reason for the unfortunate step he took. These problems can simply get solved by sharing our feelings with the near and the dear ones and consulting trained professionals in due time. Unfortunately, the lockdown has kept few people away from their close relatives and friends even then suicide should never be a choice because <strong>“suicide does not end the probabilities of life getting worse but it eliminates the possibilities of it ever getting any better.”</strong></p>
