The disagreement from Nepal\u2019s side came after India\u2019s home minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the newly built road with 80 km of distance, connecting Darchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The question to be raised now is on the duration of this major stand taken against India\u2019s claim. It isn\u2019t a concomitance that the Nepalese border controversy which was announced on May 20 coincided with the Indo-Sino border conflicts within a narrow time-frame in an area called \u201cFinger-5\u201d on the northern bank of the 134 km Pangong Tso lake on May 5 and another similar clash between Indian and Chinese troops in North Sikkim- Naku La on May 10. (<a href=\"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2020\/05\/what-to-make-of-india-and-chinas-latest-border-clash\/\">source<\/a>). This provokes us to raise a genuine question, whether Kathmandu is under the Dragons sway?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mcms.php_.jpeg\" alt=\"Nepal\" data-id=\"1618\" data-full-url=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mcms.php_.jpeg\" data-link=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/?attachment_id=1618\" class=\"wp-image-1618\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mcms.php_.jpeg 800w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mcms.php_-300x150.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mcms.php_-768x384.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"667\" height=\"401\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/sgpvthrvbj-1589818145.png\" alt=\"Nepal\" data-id=\"1619\" data-full-url=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/sgpvthrvbj-1589818145.png\" data-link=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/?attachment_id=1619\" class=\"wp-image-1619\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/sgpvthrvbj-1589818145.png 667w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/sgpvthrvbj-1589818145-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><br>Nepal is a landlocked country betwixt India and China with the Himalayas in the north, the plains in the south and this makes it dependent on either of the neighbouring countries for trade which is essential for its economy as being a small nation, geographically as well as demographically and is so far marked as \u201cLeast Developed Country\u201d (<a href=\"http:\/\/therisingnepal.org.np\/news\/15869\">LDC<\/a>) following the UN\u2019s list. India is the biggest trade partner to Nepal yet frequent contentions keeps arising between both the countries major one of which has remained unsolved since years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Roots of Indo-Nepal dispute<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Ergo, this Antecedes us to 1816, when the roots of this dispute started mushrooming. The <strong>Treaty of Sugauli<\/strong> concluded between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal in this year. The pact maps the Mahakali river as the western boundary with India but different British maps certainly exhibited the source of the tributary at different places which were mainly due to underdeveloped and less defined surveying methodologies utilized at that time. The disparity in locating the source of the river have encouraged Nepal to restructure its official map according to its claims. But In 1962 Indo-China war, Indian forces had occupied Kalapani territory after which India has been controlling it unilaterally and claims it as the source of Kali river. The Indian side had already released its updated political map depicting Kalapani as a part of its territory along with POK as part of newly formed UTs, J&amp;K and Ladakh. New Delhi considers it as a part of Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"India&#039;s border claim on Nepali territory is baseless | Juggernaut Mindset\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/65zPT8VEL1A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><br>While in contrast, the recent claims by one of Nepal\u2019s online portal have raised questions, pointing out the technical reports of the Government Of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/india-us-relations-post-indias-independence\/\">India<\/a> (GOI) of Garwhal-Kumaon region, was published by the GOI in 1911 AD which distinctly states that \u201cKuthi Yankti\u201d originates from Kang (gang), which is also called as Limpiyadhura, accordant with the official documents. In the Nepali language here Ku stands for \u2018black\u2019 and Thi means \u2018river\u2019 which together forms \u2018black river\u2019 or Kali Nadi or Kali River as known commonly. Therefore, these documents make them put their claims over Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How is the Lipulekh Pass Important For India?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">For Nepal it just being a territorial dispute, India carries strategic importance with respect to Lipulekh pass. Being surrounded by the neighbours, in this case, China, that remains averse to India\u2019s interests and has developed its frontiers with large military troops and developed infrastructure, makes it essential for India too, to advance its border areas (which was realized after the 70-day Doklam standoff), resulting in the increase of mobility in the territory for to and fro of army men and heavy machines like tanks, fighter jets, weapons etc. mainly during wars. These views were also noted by \u201c The Standing Committee On Defence\u201d, in its 2017-18 report. After the newly constructed 80 km road which goes up to the Lipu Lekh pass on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have come out as a boon for the yatris (pilgrims) travelling to \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/explained\/the-new-indian-road-to-lipu-lekh-nepals-protests-and-the-strategic-importance-of-the-area-6413914\/\">Kailash Mansarovar<\/a>\u2019 as it will reduce the time taken to travel to the mentioned home of Lord Siva located in Tibet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Following all the conundrums regarding the quest for the authority over Kalapani Lipulekh Limpiyadhura, India legally holds the sovereign jurisdiction over the claimed territory. Still, both the countries being a neighbour to each other sharing similar culture need to move ahead of this push and pull rather should find out a mutually welcomed solution through deliberations utilizing bilateral channels and must emerge as strong partners in the region. But the recent steps were taken by the KP Oli Sharma\u2019s regime soon after holding the power like introducing compulsory Chinese language in schools, joining in China\u2019s Belt And Road Initiative (BRI), allowing or rather bearing Beijing\u2019s involvement in the internal politics of Nepal etc. are worrisome and will have to uncover the black cloth over its eyes unless it&#8217;s too late. It should not ignore the dragon\u2019s old yet bold policy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/2019\/dec\/19\/chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-2078207.html\">debt trapping<\/a>. Countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Africa, Djibouti etc. have already got themselves trapped which should perhaps alarm the Nepalese government. They should ally with a pro-democratic regime like India which stands for Sustainability, Equality and Security for all in the region. On the same side, India should keep itself apart from the internal matters of Nepalese and must respect their sovereignty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Thus, the way newly established bus route from <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Janakpur-Ayodhya-bus-service\">Ayodhaya<\/a>( the birthplace of Lord Ram) was connected to Jankakpur(the birthplace of Lordess Sita) in 2018 by Modi-Oli government, it should remind both the neighbours to ameliorate its impairing relations, slowly yet steadily and unfortunately not deteriorating it at someone else\u2019s behest.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The current proximity being observed between Nepal and China especially amid Kathmandu\u2019s recent step of restructuring its national map, have led New Delhi to restructure its strategy in the Himalayas.
