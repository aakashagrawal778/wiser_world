It continued to govern and maintain an economic system separate from mainland China. Hong Kong was required to have a security law from the beginning but it didn\u2019t because of its unpopularity. Now, China has stepped in and passed a wide-ranging <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/china-passes-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\/article31950835.ece\">security law for Hong Kong<\/a> to protect its authority from what it sees as a challenge to its authority. The new law will make it easy to take down protestors and reduce the autonomy of the state. Critics have called it \u201cthe end of Hong Kong\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>About the New Law<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new security law came into force on 30th June 2020. It contains 66 Articles that deal with subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with external forces. Although the law covers the aforementioned laws, their definitions can be interpreted broadly to cover various types of speech and forms of organizing. Life imprisonment can be awarded for calling on foreign governments or publishing views which are considered anti-Beijing. So, can be awarded for making statements undermining the ruling authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-53230391\">key provisions<\/a> under the law are-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>To vandalize public property would be considered terrorism;<\/li><li>Breaking away from the country, colliding with foreign governments, using violence against persons or property, going against the central government is punishable with life imprisonment at maximum;<\/li><li>Beijing would establish a new security office in Hong Kong which won\u2019t be under the local jurisdiction;<\/li><li>Those convicted under this law won\u2019t be allowed to stand for public offices;<\/li><li>Companies can be fined if found guilty;<\/li><li>The new security office can transfer cases to mainland china for trials;<\/li><li>Neither the judicial offices nor the public bodies would have the authority to interpret the law, the power rests with Beijing authorities when the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law;<\/li><li>People can be wire-trapped and put in surveillance if authorities suspect them for breaking the law;<\/li><li>Trials can take place behind closed doors;<\/li><li>The law would also apply to outsiders<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Threat to Hong Kong?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The people of Hong Kong are afraid of their freedom under the law. Beijing has said that people should protect their rights and liberties while safeguarding the nation\u2019s authority. Reports show that the people have started deleting posts from the fear of being prosecuted under the new law. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China, but now it is feared that it won\u2019t be independent anymore and would look like Mainland China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 1st July, Hong Kong completed 23 years of Handover by Britain to China. Usually observed by a long march, thousands of people gathered to protest and were arrested for crimes that did not exist a day before. Around 370 people were arrested, out of which 10 were arrested for the new law which protects Beijing from challenging political activities. The law threatens the cultural scene and civil liberty that exists in Hong Kong which makes it different from the rest of China.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people from Hong Kong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/29\/world\/asia\/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html\">wish to emigrate<\/a>, a task which was promised to be made easier by Britain. The British government informed that some Hong Kongers would be allowed to live in Britain for five years and then would be allowed to apply for citizenship. Not only the citizens but international organizations are also evaluating their future in the city because the new law said that the government would strengthen the management of foreign NGOs and news agencies. Many Activists have deleted their accounts from social media platforms like twitter and telegram fearing their past activities might lend them in trouble.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua Wong, who is perhaps the best-known activist, announced that he is quitting from his youth political group named Demosisto which was founded in the year 2016, citing concerns for his safety. After that, three other leading members left the group leading to an announcement of the disbanding of the group altogether. News agencies have been asked by authors to take down their posts. The central government assured that the law is to bring stability but chaos seems to be all around the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/HongKong-1280p-min-1-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"hong kong\" class=\"wp-image-1898\" width=\"625\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/HongKong-1280p-min-1-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/HongKong-1280p-min-1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/HongKong-1280p-min-1-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/HongKong-1280p-min-1-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_main_large\/public\/HongKong-1280p.jpg?itok=t74mI9_Y\">ScienceMag<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is the Motive of China?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997 over a small agreement- a mini-constitution for Hong Kong called the basic law and a \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms of Hong Kong which no other part of China has. Under Article 23 of the basic law, Hong Kong was supposed to enact a security law that did not happen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Protests over an extradition law turned violent and resulted in an anti-China movement. China does not wish to have it again. The law punishes protestors to protect the authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>India\u2019s Stand on the Law<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the ongoing tensions on borders with China, India on Wednesday made statements stating that it hoped that the relevant parties would address the concerns \u201cproperly, seriously and objectively\u201d while not naming china. The statement was made by <a href=\"https:\/\/thewire.in\/diplomacy\/in-new-line-after-lac-clash-india-asks-china-to-address-hong-kong-security-law-concerns\">India\u2019s representative<\/a> at the ongoing UN human rights council in Geneva. India urged the security council to seriously address the matter of recent developments in Hong Kong, as it is home to substantial Indian Community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Standing up for Hong Kong is in India\u2019s interest both diplomatically and politically because as per sources Hong Kong is India\u2019s top trading partner as opposed to China and India shares a history with Hong Kong since the early 19th century- be it, Indian soldiers, fighting for the city or entrepreneurs adding to the dynamics of their market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>China and India are currently amid a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/ladakh-intrusion-swerving-from-an-uncaring-towards-a-dancing-dragon-yet-treacherous\/\">military stand-off <\/a>on borders in 45 years. India lost 20 soldiers last month, in a clash with the Chinese troops. India has remained silent over protests at Hong Kong over several years, so a statement by India is significant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last Friday, the UN independent experts in a joint statement asked the human rights council to hold a session to monitor abuses like \u201cMoves against people of Hong Kong\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new law introduced by China to protect the government in power is being demonstrated as an end of Hong Kong by the critics. It increases Beijing\u2019s power on the city-state threatening freedom of people residing in Hong Kong. Arrests under the new law have been made on grounds that did not exist until a few days ago, forcing citizens, multinational organizations, news forces etc to ponder over their future. Even if China claims the new law&#8217;s power to bring back stability, the current situation seems to be creating fear while dominating the rights the city enjoys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On 1st July 1997, the United Kingdom ended their administration for Hong Kong and handed over the control of the colony to china; popularly known as Handover of Hong Kong.
