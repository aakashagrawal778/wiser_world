Termed by United Nations Women as the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/news\/stories\/2020\/4\/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic\">shadow pandemic<\/a>\u2019, this notion aims to highlight that as 90 countries move into lockdown mode, more than four billion people on the planet are staying home; and as a result, instances of violence against women and girls has spiked up drastically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Confinement in homes, and lack of steady incomes, seems to have been fostering tensions and frustration in households and strain due to concerns over health and security. The lockdown is also putting women in isolation with violent partners, with nowhere to turn to for help. In India, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/ncw-records-sharp-spike-in-domestic-violence-amid-lockdown\/article31835105.ece\">National Commission for Women<\/a> has reported a 200 per cent increase in the reporting and stress call numbers of domestic violence on their helpline in the month of June alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Even before the lockdown was imposed, domestic violence was one of the most prevalent violations of human rights and a key impediment to the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with one in three women have experienced it at some point in their lives. Economist&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/gender-ratio#how-many-women-are-missing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amartya Sen<\/a>&nbsp;has estimated in 1990 that more than 100 million women are \u2018missing\u2019 \u2014 that includes those that never lived because of sex-selective abortions and infanticide, child neglect and maltreatment. That number was revised in 2015 to 136 million \u2013 this just shows how females have been subject to violence, at times even before they are born, at an alarmingly high rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Furthermore, it is essential to address that violence against women not only affects individuals, but also households, families and communities. However, the only way to change this stark reality is to hold the aggressors accountable and ensure that the problematic social norms that perpetuate the instances of violence are also tackled in an inclusive manner. The SDGs act as an apt framework to work off of, in order to shape a violence-free world \u2013 here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 1: No Poverty<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Women\u2019s work \u2013 in agriculture, in communities, and at home, fuels economies and yet, isn\u2019t regarded as \u2018economic activity\u2019. The exposure of females to incessant discrimination and mistreatment at the workplace makes them vulnerable and susceptible to gender-based violence. Women and girls are four per cent more likely to live in poverty and poor living conditions, a risk that rises up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/digital-library\/publications\/2019\/09\/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2019\">twenty-five <\/a>per<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/digital-library\/publications\/2019\/09\/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2019\"> cent<\/a> as we factor-in other inequalities. Financial independence for women creates new opportunities and avenues for them to reject typical gender norms and leverage independence against violent partners. It also helps them to create a mentality of freedom and a sense of self for themselves. As a result, the reduction in poverty proves to be a catalyst towards enabling women in societies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 4: Quality Education<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">An <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@UNDP\/no-development-without-safety-for-all-aefe2d74a653\">estimated<\/a> 246 million girls and boys experience school-related violence every year and one in four girls say that they never feel comfortable using school washrooms, according to a survey on youth conducted across four regions by the United Nations. Quality education is essential to ending violence against women. Educated girls are more likely to make their decisions towards family planning and managing finances, it is fundamental for the development of aspirations and skills, and children of educated women are more likely to have been safeguarded against malnutrition and illiteracy. Educational exposure also enables women to get access to leadership and decision-making opportunities. Hence, it propels them into a cycle of development that helps them create barriers to economic violence at home or in their communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 5: Gender Equality<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">According to a 2018 <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@UNDP\/no-development-without-safety-for-all-aefe2d74a653\">report<\/a> by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in India, 18 per cent of women and girls aged between 15 and 49 years of age have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or family member in the past twelve months. Further, someone is known to them \u2013 <em>every day<\/em> kills more than 137 women around the world. These figures represent a fraction of the discrimination against women in terms of opportunities, wealth, inheritance, safe access to public spaces, lack of decent work, and safe and healthy environments of living, learning, working, and engaging with their communities. These inequalities leave them extremely vulnerable to gender-based violence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Unsafe and poor working environments affect women regardless of their age, location, income, careers, or social standing. As of 2020, 18 countries have laws that enable husbands in preventing their wives from going to work. UN Women&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/what-we-do\/economic-empowerment\/facts-and-figures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estimates<\/a>&nbsp;that the economic costs of violence and harassment amount to US$12 trillion every year. As of 2018, 59 countries do not have laws protecting women from sexual harassment in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/wbl.worldbank.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">workplace<\/a>. Economic growth cannot be achieved without the inclusion of women and their contribution to sustainable development in an empowering work environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In developing countries, concerns of safety and restricted access to public transport reduce the probability of women participating in the labour market by 16.5 per cent. As the processes of urbanization and industrialization catch up to tier two and tier three cities, the UN estimates that more than 5 billion people will reside in cities by 2030. This becomes an essential notion to address in the light of crimes against women that are prevalent in most urban regions. Further, there is widespread human rights abuse in many industries, such as fast fashion, many of which employ women in majorities. Women may be subject to exploitation in such circumstances and need to be safeguarded against such instances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In 37 countries, rape perpetrators are exempt from legal prosecution if they are married to, or subsequently marry the victim. Improving access to justice for survivors, and strengthening the legal framework against violators is an essential step towards making justice accessible for women \u2013 be it against violence, sexual misconduct at the workplace, or any crime against them. It is further imperative for women to mobilize and advocate support for their personal rights and those of their communities. This can be done digitally, individually, or at any level.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">At this point in time, COVID-19 is already testing humanity in unprecedented capacities. The shadow pandemic that we have had to face additionally is a mirror to the kind of societies we have built for ourselves so far. As we emerge from the pandemic, we must renew the outlooks towards inequalities and factor them into our responses to create a more equitable and sustainably sound world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the twenty-first century, as the world grapples with a deadly pandemic, another sub-pandemic seems to be taking roots in most societies \u2013 that of domestic violence against women.
