The state&#8217;s Parliamentary Affairs Minister Neiba Kronu disclosed that \u201cthe decision to ban commercial import and trading of dogs, and sale of dog meat, both cooked and raw, was taken during a state cabinet meeting\u201d according to <a href=\"https:\/\/thewire.in\/article\/government\/nagaland-bans-sale-consumption-of-dog-meat\/amp\">theWire<\/a>. The decision was taken keeping in mind the dangers associated with importing dogs from other states for consumption and the decision is also in line with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, Kronu, who is the spokesperson of the government, said. \u201cThe state government has decided to ban commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked. Appreciate the wise decision taken by the state\u2019s cabinet,\u201d chief secretary Temjen Toy said in a tweet. All this happened after the Minister of Women and Child Development Smt. Maneka Gandhi <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pfaindia\/status\/1277886966772555776\/photo\/2\">shared photos<\/a> she had received of captured dogs from \u2018unknown\u2019 sources.

The image on social media caused a huge outcry as the Twitteratis claimed that the dogs were being taken to Nagaland for sale (illegally). Pritish Nandy, a journalist and a poet tweeted with attaching the above photo:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is urgent.

The local animal rights activists said it was issued due to the fear that dogs might transmit the novel-coronavirus. As soon as Maneka Gandhi got to know about the order she <a href=\"https:\/\/easternmirrornagaland.com\/shoot-at-sight-order-for-dogs-is-illegal-maneka-gandhi-writes-to-rio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote <\/a>to the state Chief Minister, Rio, seeking his intervention to reverse the order. A couple of dog deaths were reported from villages in Nagaland in June, after which ThePrint <a href=\"https:\/\/theprint.in\/india\/nagaland-bans-sale-of-dog-meat-after-incidents-of-pets-being-shot-at-sight-spark-outrage\/454322\/?amp\">reported<\/a> a member of the Nagaland Animal Welfare Society (NAWS), an NGO saying that, \u201cIt is believed that dogs might spread the virus, also that few dogs have been loitering around the waste near quarantine centers, which can harm the locality\/public in general, for which dogs were asked to be chained 24\/7.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Hypocrisy of the Ban<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The dog meat ban in Nagaland has raised a debate on the hypocritical nature of the ban. Prominent journalist Rohini Singh in response to Pritish Nandy\u2019s tweet, tweeted \u201cAm sorry but while I don\u2019t eat dog meat but how is eating dog meat more immoral than eating fish or chicken or goat? Either you eat meat or you don\u2019t. Why take our sense of morality and impose it on other people?\u201d  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">While on the other hand the guardian <a href=\"https:\/\/amp.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/jul\/04\/indian-state-of-nagaland-bans-sale-of-dog-meat\">reported <\/a>&nbsp;Animal rights advocacy group Humane Society International as saying, \u201cThis is a major turning point in ending the cruelty in India\u2019s hidden dog meat trade.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The people who oppose this ban are of the opinion that parameters must be equal for all, one can\u2019t ban dog meat and allow the consumption of chicken or fish or any other non-veg food. Sarvej Talreja writes in his piece for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arre.co.in\/social-commentary\/dog-meat-ban-nagas-northeast-indians\/\">Arre<\/a>, \u201cthis ban is far more complex than a victory for animal rights advocates and dog lovers. It\u2019s an indication of a particular kind of hypocrisy: a hypocrisy that holds only certain kinds of meat legitimate under the garb of \u201cethical\u201d eating; a hypocrisy that seeks to impose a singular \u201cpalatable\u201d version of eating habits on the rest of the country. Let\u2019s call the ban for what it is \u2013 an erosion of the personal freedom of the Nagas and another highly publicised but wholly unnecessary action propagated by someone in a position of power over a minority.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The decision to ban dog meat is itself controversial and calls for questioning. People in North East are upset by the way the decision was taken by the state government; there was absolutely no consultation with the Naga tribes, who are the consumers of dog meat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eastmojo.com\/opinion\/2020\/07\/04\/dog-meat-ban-in-nagaland-is-about-showing-naga-tribes-as-uncivilised\">Richard Kamai<\/a>, &#8220;the ban sheds light on how it overlooked Article 371A of Nagaland which bestows Nagaland a special right to allow Naga tribes to practice and maintain their customary law and social practice.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Daribha Lyndem writes in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/daribhalyndem\/dont-ask-me-if-i-eat-dog\">essay<\/a> titled \u201cWhat You\u2019re Really Asking When You Ask Me If I Eat Dog\u201d about her Northeast roots, \u201cIn contrast to the eating habits of mainstream Indian society, no meal in the Northeast is complete without rice and meat. The Nagas, like many other Northeastern tribes, come from proud hunting cultures, while much of the heartland of India are pastoral agriculturalists. While many Naga communities have moved upward economically and don\u2019t have to hunt to survive anymore, in rural and poor families, having a fresh game on your dinner table is still a matter of pride.\u201d She also states that dog meat is eaten remotely in the Northeast but those who eat it do not consider the practice shameful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">This blatant and absolute use of power by the state government is an attempt to trap the Naga tribes and their culture to make them feel bad for what they are. Look around the mainstream societies, there is absolutely no space for indigenous food from the northeast. But people of these mainstream societies are now dictating the decisions related to northeasterners food choices. It\u2019s nothing but an inadvertent attempt to make them feel bad for their food practices. This is a classic case of racism and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/cultural-imperialism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cultural imperialism<\/a> in the name of showing \u2018love\u2019 for animals. The sheer ignorance to not acknowledge and not accept the cultural differences is not new and has subjected thousands of northeasterners to racism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Hypocrisy Does Not End Here<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">An anthropologist Dolly Kikon in his <a href=\"https:\/\/scroll.in\/article\/849123\/barking-up-the-wrong-tree-why-the-debate-on-eating-dog-meat-in-india-and-globally-is-hypocritical?fbclid=IwAR3mj8-hGpPRN9T_W8ytO7z4s75AZaoq0bc705e7gCv-j9OsJ3l6HrbZBF0\">opinion piece<\/a> writes, that the rest of India has historically treated stray dogs as an urban menace, often embarking on elaborate campaigns to mass murder them. But, \u201cthinking of dog meat as part of a food system, or linking it to larger issues of food culture or taste, does not cross the minds of many Indians, that is the reason why, although stray dogs are defined as pets and killed by state authorities every day, it is morally incomprehensible to label them as a food choice.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The ban clearly reflects the hypocrisy of society. While eating chicken, mutton, lamb etc are considered normal, dog meat is considered immoral and unethical. People easily forget that \u201cas much as \u201cnot eating dog meat\u201d is a part of one\u2019s culture, there are certain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eastmojo.com\/opinion\/2020\/07\/04\/dog-meat-ban-in-nagaland-is-about-showing-naga-tribes-as-uncivilised\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">communities<\/a> where dog meat is taken as a part of their food culture.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Because of the prejudice and harmful stereotypes regarding northeasterners that they are uncivilized, the so-called \u2018mainstream Indian society\u2019 has not been able to accept them. By ignoring their culture, mainstream society tells them that not only the mainstream is better than them but also it shames them for being different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Nagaland state government on 3rd July banned the sale and consumption of dog meat, in a consequential decision amid growing concerns over cruelty to dogs.
