The Cold war between these two superpowers had practically divided the entire world (except the NAM countries) into two alliances &#8211; Western &amp; Eastern. The Western Alliance which was later formalised into NATO was led by the US and joined by most of the Western European countries, as the name suggests. Since it\u2019s the foundation, the policy of \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nato.int\/cps\/en\/natohq\/topics_110496.htm\">Collective Defense<\/a>\u201d has been at the heart of the Alliance, the policy being a declaration by its member states that an armed attack on one of them would be considered an attack on all of the NATO countries and therefore, all these countries would be obliged to retaliate. This policy, therefore, brings about a spirit of solidarity within the member countries.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cold war era continued to witness a major military role played by the Alliance, particularly after the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies united themselves by the <strong>Warsaw Pact in 1955<\/strong>, as a counter-power to the rising NATO forces in Europe. The formation of the Warsaw Pact was triggered by the gradual enlargement of NATO which was joined by West Germany in 1955 and now constituted fifteen member states, with the original member states of <strong>Belgium, Britain, Canada, Italy, Iceland, France, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United States<\/strong>, later joined by Greece and Turkey in 1952. At its height, the tension between the NATO Alliance and Warsaw Pact countries was symbolized by the construction of the <strong>Berlin Wall in 1961<\/strong>, which was perhaps the greatest physical representation of the Cold War, as it was seen to be dividing East Germany from West Germany, and their respective Western and Eastern European counterparts. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min-1024x994.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2153\" width=\"558\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min-1024x994.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min-300x291.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min-768x746.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min-1536x1492.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/b9903e83-f5f2-48e6-8537-6933340d9d05-min.jpg 1558w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" \/><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.cgtn.com%2Fnews%2F316b444e33677a6333566d54%2Fshare.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw16qYiiooj4Y4hYLLsgwVS1&amp;ust=1595168720454000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAMQjB1qFwoTCMDRhdyA1-oCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD\">CGTN<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was almost apparent during this time that neither party had any desire of engaging in serious conflict. Thus, for the entirety of the Cold War era, the two superpowers never engaged in a real nuclear exchange and although a few armed conflicts probably emerged, there are no shreds of evidence and thus cannot account for any major conflict between the two superpowers. In fact, a major portion of the time period when the Soviet Union was still alive, a <strong>\u2018Detente\u2019 <\/strong>phase, had existed which basically meant that both the blocs accepted the status quo and did not make any attempts to change it by creating newer sources of conflict among each other and their allies. Therefore, in the 1960\u2019s the conventional role that NATO played as a defence organisation had undergone a major reshuffling that began with this new phase of the relationship which saw the rise of the new strategic concept of <strong>\u2018Flexible Response\u2019<\/strong>. As now the Alliance had greater avenues of military responses in events of the conflict, moving away from the earlier binary provided by the \u2018<strong>Massive Retaliation\u2019<\/strong> strategic concept between, a total nuclear exchange or peace. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gradually, the Soviet Union began to disintegrate for economic (heavy defence expenditure, lower standards of living among people), political and ideological reasons. Although NATO continued to hold its ground, in the world sphere of military and defence. While the Warsaw Pact ended in 1991, it was not as if, NATO\u2019s transition was smooth sailing post-1991. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, US was the only superpower left in the world, and therefore, this created a sort of political vacuum (US dominance with no strong power to contend it), which NATO sought to balance out by introducing various measures like the establishment of the <strong>North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the Mediterranean dialogue<\/strong>, etc. It also lent its support to the United Nations in ending wars such as <strong>Yugoslavian Civil War<\/strong> but perhaps in its striving for engaging in legitimate and righteous actions, the NATO has often also engaged in some actions, deemed as illegal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be best illustrated by the case of the Kosovar Albanians, when NATO in June 1999, carried out airstrikes so as to prevent the native Kosovar Albanians from going through ethnic cleansing that was being carried out by the Serbian ruling population. What made these actions illegal, despite their righteous purpose was that it was not backed by the UN Security Council\u2019s authorization and also defied the UN Charter, which had declared that NATO can only be activated in case of one of its member countries being under a threat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In modern times, the issue of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/nato-burden-sharing-need-strategy-and-force-plans-not-meaningless-percentage-goals\">\u201cburden-sharing\u201d<\/a> within NATO, has become one of great importance and can be considered as a reason for increasing unpopularity of NATO within some member countries like the US. While some observers had raised this issue even in the earlier times, it was most recently brought up by the US President <strong>Donald Trump<\/strong> in the July 2018 Summit of the organization. He has put growing pressure on the Eastern European countries within the alliance and more so on those who have consistently failed to meet the two major goals &#8211; spending 2% of the country\u2019s GDP in defence (4% according to the July Summit) and 20% of defence spending on equipment purchases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its various shortcomings and controversial actions, it would not be an exaggeration to say that NATO has also undertaken various initiatives for the good of the world. The organization which constitutes about <strong>30 member states<\/strong> in 2020, has undergone significant enlargement since it\u2019s the foundation. Although, enlargement has not only been limited to an increase in the number of members but also on an ideological scale. While it started off primarily as a defence organization, relating to matters of security and peace of its member countries, the conventional definition of \u201csecurity\u201d has also changed. Therefore stimulating changes in the way NATO works to keep maintaining the security not only of its member countries but also of non-member countries. Peacekeeping and Peacemaking have become its priorities, which is not an easy work in any time period and especially not in the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century, which has seen newer innovations in technology than any other age. In lieu of recent events, NATO countries have also played an equally significant role in helping to tackle the global pandemic of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nato.int\/cps\/en\/natohq\/news_175694.htm\">COVID \u2013 19<\/a> by primarily sending supplies and equipment, where it was required. For instance, the Czech Republic and Turkey sent medical supplies to Spain and Italy, when they requested for help.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore,&nbsp;the nature of NATO as an organization has changed quite drastically from its foundation days and describes the evolving role played by NATO in the world, in terms of military power, security, peace, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or NATO which was established in April of 1949, continues to remain an important player in affairs of security and peace in the world stage, although it has significantly moved away from its earlier narrow definition of the largest military cooperation group of the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":29,"featured_media":2152,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[104,499,968],"tags":[510,508,38,506,507,509,511],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>THE EVOLVING ROLE OF NATO: A BRIEF HISTORY &amp;
