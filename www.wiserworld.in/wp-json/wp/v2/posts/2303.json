Sino-American relations could never have been categorised as warm, but the latest spurt of hostility has marked a new low in ties in recent times. With America pointing the finger at China for mishandling the Covid-19 crisis, a truce does not seem in sight in the near future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The US-China Dispute<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The Red Dragon and Uncle Sam have a lengthy history of being at loggerheads. The US initially refused to recognise China as a sovereign state and indulged in many ministrations to displace the latter\u2019s communist roots.&nbsp; It was only in the 1970s that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/timeline\/us-relations-china\">diplomatic relations<\/a> took flight with the US acceptance of One China Policy. Still, their relations were fraught with friction, especially over human rights. When China entered the world economy and began opening up its economy, its engagement enhanced, with China going on to become America\u2019s largest trading partner. With a few hiccups, the relationship seemed to be aiming for cooperation. However, it all radically changed in 2018 when the Trump government\u2019s tariffs targetted China, setting off a vicious trade war that is still ongoing. What started out as a trade dispute couple of years ago has now turned into a full-blown show of might, branching into other areas as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In late 2018, the US signaled its hardline approach towards the eastern giant. The Huawei issue only intensified the same, and the US has done everything in its power to kick the Chinese MNC out of the 5G race on charges of spying. By 2019, the trade war had intensified, with both countries levying hefty tariffs on the other, and placing various other sanctions as well. Early 2020 saw the signing of a trade deal which provided a brief breather for the economic world, but the respite period remained short. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic sent the global economy tumbling. America faced multi-faceted effects: its capitalist system suffered a downfall and the health system was brought to its knees. This tension had the hegemon accusing China of mismanaging the pandemic and causing harm to the world, eventually pulling out of WHO due to the latter\u2019s support of China. China obviously, did not take the accusations well. But it was the new security law imposed in Hong Kong that proved to be the last nail in the coffin. Trump went on to strip the city of its special status, reducing its credibility as a world economic and financial hub. China accused America of interfering in its domestic affairs, and everything has been downhill since.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Asian Playground<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Due to the deterrence that comes with two giants battling each other, the countries are unlikely to engage in an all-out war, even if relations have diminished to a new low. Their historical animosity played out in the Asian region much like the proxy wars that dominated the global landscape during the Cold War. Both nations have tried to expand the ambit of their influence by espousing Asia-centric policies. Obama\u2019s presidency saw a more active role in the region coupled with an enhanced military presence. China on the other hand relies on its <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.wharton.upenn.edu\/digital\/what-u-s-china-proxy-wars-mean-for-asias-balancing-act\/\">geo-economic power<\/a> to bind Asia to it. The Belt and Road initiative, the String of Pearls approach, ADB Bank and increasing economic investment promises financial advancement for the region. South Asia in one of the most populous regions in the world, yet intra-regional trade is quite fragmented (just 5%), which reduces the economic benefits it can reap. Thus China\u2019s meteoric economic rise has proved to be a fundamental driver of economic growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">US security cover coupled with economic benefits from China has helped in the advancement of many countries, resulting in the expectation that Southeast Asia will become the fourth-largest economy in the world, overtaking the European Union and Japan by 2050. Therefore for Southeast Asian nations, especially the ASEAN market is a key area for both America and China. The US is now frantically looking to shift Asian loyalties to its side as it perceives the rising Chinese aggression and economic strength as a threat.&nbsp; That is why it has taken a strong position against China\u2019s assertions in the South China Sea and has tried to play on the insecurities of the latter\u2019s neighbours regarding the same. This \u2018harbinger of justice\u2019 role has helped the nation gain influence in the region, which was a difficult task because of China\u2019s proximity to it. America is also banking on its military and technological investment to gain the region\u2019s unequivocal support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Since the beginning of the Sino-American trade war, Southeast Asia has been an undisputed winner on account of the benefits it is reaping. The high American tariffs on Chinese goods have led to a shift in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/week-asia\/economics\/article\/3019381\/will-trumps-trade-crusade-ultimately-benefit-southeast-asia\">manufacturing processes<\/a> to the region. In 2019 Chinese acoustics manufacturer Goertek announced that it will shift its Apple\u2019s Airpods wireless headphones production to Vietnam because of the ongoing trade dispute. Similarly, Cambodia has bagged bicycle production for a high-value US firm, and Thailand has become a hub of vehicle assembly plants. According to Forbes, a survey of U.S. firms manufacturing in China found that 18.5% had either moved production to Southeast Asia or were considering it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Usually, ASEAN countries have been able to maintain a delicate balance between American geopolitics and Chinese geo-economics. But as both countries increase the heat, it is difficult to predict if the future will force the region to choose sides. For now, Southeast Asia is having a good ride!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Indian Factor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/kcmodi0312_0-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2382\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/kcmodi0312_0-1.jpg 780w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/kcmodi0312_0-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/kcmodi0312_0-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" \/><figcaption><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/asia\/se-asia\/asean-summit-modi-says-india-ready-to-increase-partnerships-with-asean\">The Straits Times<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">India has been facing a sudden increase in tensions with China too. The border dispute has led to a fresh impasse, the first one since Doklam. But this time the costs have been higher, with multiple skirmishes and martyred soldiers lining the situation. In response, India, akin to America, has tried to economically isolate China by banning 59 Chinese apps and making calls for being \u2018Aatmanirbhar\u2019. But it is easier said than done, for the mammoth amount of trade between the two is skewed in China\u2019s favour. Some would think it is natural for India to lean on the US, especially in view of the latter\u2019s vocal support of India in the afore-mentioned border dispute. It is to an extent true too: India has gained around $755 million in US exports since the trade war disrupted relations. India is also the only country capable of countering China\u2019s influence in a disintegrated Asia. It also has a large youthful population capable of rapid mass production which it could use to its advantage in view of the trade war.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">But the path is not as smooth as it looks. There are multiple factors that <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/economy\/foreign-trade\/india-unlikely-to-benefit-from-us-china-trade-tensions-eiu\/articleshow\/71721119.cms\">weigh India down<\/a> as compared to Southeast Asia when it comes to being business-savvy. The country has a massive supply of cheap labour but lags glaringly in other areas. Poor infrastructure to accommodate foreign production, inadequate technology, complicated labour laws and red-tapism of a sloth-like bureaucracy have tainted the country\u2019s hopes of attracting foreign investment. That is why despite improving its Ease of Doing Business rankings by 37 places, it still is only the ninth-largest trading partner of the USA. Its tedious land-acquisition laws coupled with hostile neighbourhoods have not done much to attract investors. In addition to this, India\u2019s decision to not be a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maritime-executive.com\/editorials\/india-backs-away-from-southeast-asia-trade-deal\">trade agreement<\/a> with ASEAN called Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has put it on the back foot. It passed up on a chance to economically seal the deal with the fastest growing economic region and its markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In view of these shortcomings, Southeast Asia proves to be a better region to direct investments to. In fact, India is not extremely affected by the trade war as it has not gained much from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The United States of America and China are the two hegemons that balance the current multi-polar world. This grandiosity of sorts, coupled with their mutual interdependence in terms of trade and technology makes it difficult for them to inflict real-time damage on each other, or indulge in an all-out confrontation. That being said, the current animosity between the two is different from their usual spats. In this pandemic-riddled world their tensions have been aggravated by blame-game, allegations of spying, erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s democratic rights and of course, the rejuvenated trade-war. Many Asian countries have benefitted from this fallout and gained increased investment from the US and more come-hither offers by China. It is now to see how their balancing act will progress. However, India has a long way to trudge before it can fully reap the benefits of the clash and needs to work on its internal infrastructure and policies to attract any advantages.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the midst of a pandemic, the world is witnessing the emergence of a neo-cold war: the US and China are embroiled in a dispute that has kept everyone on edge.
