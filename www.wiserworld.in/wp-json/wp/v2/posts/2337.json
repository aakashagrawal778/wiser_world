While some Gender Scholars try to define and research on this subject, there is a mass of people who are not aware of the very meaning and nature of Gender. &nbsp;Historically in India, the significance of gender has been prevalent and strongly felt during the times of partition. Violence against women on both sides emphasized their symbolic roles in they become in family, community or class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The notion that gender is binary, that is when gender is recognised in only two terms \u2013 male and female is highly refuted. Social research has shown there are as many as 52 genders. Some definitions of gender overlap and some change over time, as a cultural change. One would commonly encounter individuals who would identify themselves as cis-gendered &#8211; a label whose personal gender identity is the same as the sex they were assigned to at birth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Cisnormativity is the notion that a cis-gender identity is a socially accepted norm. This leads to discrimination and creates stronger social setbacks for those who do not fit in this norm. It has thus become important to understand gender closely and use appropriate language and gender. This not only promotes inclusivity but also lets people know one is supporting and affirming to the other person\u2019s gender. For example, a genderfluid person moves between different gender presentations. The individual may identify as masculine one day and on another day, the individual may identify as a femme or woman. Hence, the use of gender-neutral pronouns such as \u201cthey\/them\u201d is encouraged for genderfluid people<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Gender becomes the most conspicuous difference between humans and animals and it manifests itself psychologically. Traditional western viewpoints designate males and females as binary opposite and argue that gender is inescapable. But this is not the case anymore. In our social surroundings, gender plays an important role. Through this article, we learn about the meaning of gender and its distinction from sex along with some cases and examples. We identify the common gender-related discrimination and understand the true sense of the word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Tryst with High Heels<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The famous red-soled Louboutin with their breathtakingly high or rather painful stilettos are reserved for the women\u2019s section and viewed as a commodity for the feminine gender only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">A commodity restricted to gender, strikes as a strange idea to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The retailer asked, in a rather monotonous tone to my friend, \u201cWhich size ma\u2019am?\u201d and then when we told him it is for me, a he! At once the retailer was taken aback and for a fraction of second, we could see the gears in his brain process the information. Well, we tried the shoe, it wasn\u2019t a perfect fit, end of the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Brief History of Gendered Commodities<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Historically, high heeled shoes were initially designed for upper class men to use when hunting on horseback, an activity considered fairly masculine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">With time, as women began wearing high heels, male heels slowly became shorter and fatter as female heels grew taller and thinner. Over time the perception of the high heels gradually became seen as feminine. There is nothing intrinsically feminine about high heeled shoes. My friend enjoyed wearing my \u2018Peanuts\u2019 themed Vans sneakers but, she wasn\u2019t subjected to gender horrified looks or old auntie gasps. Such has happened because social norms have made it so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Gender roles are not set in stone. It varies from society to society and time as well. It is susceptible to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Understanding Gender from Biological Sex<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/egehztz-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2350\" width=\"549\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/egehztz-1.png 1000w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/egehztz-1-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/egehztz-1-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" \/><figcaption><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/e\/gender-vs-sex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dictionary.com<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The baffled expression of the retailer tells us something which runs much deeper in the texts of Gender Psychology and its social perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines gender as \u201cthe socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Through the social lens, gender becomes a much broader term. While sex refers to an individual\u2019s biological status as either male or female; gender refers to the person\u2019s sense of expression of their maleness and femaleness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviours. This includes how they should interact with others or of the same or opposite sex, within micro and macro levels of societies. Such as households, classrooms, communities, religious places, sports fields and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Individuals or groups who do not fit established gender norms, often face stigma, discriminatory practices and subjected to social exclusion. This in return has an adverse effect on health- both their physical and mental wellbeing. For example, the atrocities acted upon the hijra community in South-East Asia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Cross-cultural and historical evidence do challenge this limited ideology and many gender-based stereotypes. The early rise of 20th-century feminism emerging as a social and political force has been fighting for equal opportunities and challenging traditional sexism of patriarchy.&nbsp; This viewpoint is further supplemented with an interesting case from the Philippines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Case from the Philippines<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">PETA, acronym for Philippine Educational Theatre Association, a non-stock, non-profit organisation found in 1967 by Cecile Guidote gave the women of Philippines a strong voice. Under PETA, the Women\u2019s Theatre Program (WTP) becomes an artistic medium that eventually becomes a weapon in the face of conservative political and religious influences which had been oppressing the women of the nation, solely due to their gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">When PETA was formed, the Philippines was suffering from the dictatorship of President Marcos, making major gender inequality gaps and oppressing women. The WTP explores issues such as violence against women, prostitution and trafficking, poverty and reproductive right for women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s PETA took seriously the task of leading a national theatre movement that would fight Marco\u2019s dictatorship. They believed the struggle for social justice, women empowerment, democracy and equality amongst gender should also be urged on the educational and cultural fronts. The importance was paramount because without shaping people\u2019s consciousness, the change will never prove lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sartorial Sexism<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">We dive deeper in the social perspective of gender in current times with the life examples of author Vicki S. Helgeson in her book The Psychology of Gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">When her daughter was born, in 1998, Helgeson was exposed to the psychology of gender far more than as an advocate of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">She observed that after dressing up her baby in gender neutral clothes, passer-by\u2019s often mistook the infant for a boy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In her book she explains, the biological default is female. At conception, the embryo is destined to become female unless exposed to male hormones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">But the social default is male. When in doubt, assume the baby is a boy unless strong social cues are present, indicating the baby is a girl such as the pink, the bow, the specific patterns on toys and clothes. Further, she observed that it is not nearly as offensive to assume a girl is a boy as it is to assume a boy is a girl. She was surprised to find out how apologetic people become when they guess a baby boy for a girl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Sartorial sexism stands strong within infants as it stood against me in Marks &amp; Spencer. Infant clothes and toys are divided, with strict hints of sexism present. Slogans on apparels such as \u2018Daddy\u2019s Little Princess\u2019 are for girls, expecting them to behave in a certain manner while for boys there are \u2018Daddy\u2019s Handyman\u2019 reinforcing the machoism at an age when they cannot spell the very word. Symbolism also strictly divides dress codes with a pair of denims with stars and glitters are considered for boys and rugged or faded jeans are kept for girls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Something seemed funny in that last line, didn\u2019t it? And that is the social perspective of gender we carry today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The nature of gender roles varies from society to society and time as well, such as certain commodities have shifted from one gender to another through time. Sex and Gender are two distinguished terms where sex relates to the biology of the individual and gender relates to the expression of behaviour from the individual. Gender manifests itself psychologically and if individuals do not fit the societal gender norms, they often face discrimination and subjugation from the dominant gender. Cecile Guidve initiative in 1967 lead to the creation of the Women\u2019s Theatre Program (WTP) under the Philippine Educational Theatre Association (PETA) which fought gender inequality from both educational and cultural means. Sartorial sexism exists in our society and manifests itself through symbolic slogans, colour and fashion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gender has been a much-debated topic currently.
