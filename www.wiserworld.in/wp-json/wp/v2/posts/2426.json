The exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases has not deterred the country from following through on its agenda. In the last two months, the country has found itself at loggerheads with the Chinese Red Dragon over the border issues at the Galwan Valley, which led to a spate of talks between the Special Representatives and the army personnel. As India\u2019s relations with China in the East soured, its relations with Pakistan in the West, experienced no such events that would taint the relations any further. In fact, the two countries exchanged a prisoners list on the 1st of July, under the 2008 agreement. However, in an unprovoked breach of the ceasefire by Pakistan, the Indians recently incurred a loss of civilian lives. Lastly, Mr Narendra Modi\u2019s address at the United Nations Economic and Social Council is much looked forward to and caps an eventful week in India. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some major updates to cover in today&#8217;s Indian Foreign Policy Report are as follow:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>United Nations Economic and Social Council<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">On the 75th anniversary of the United Nations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/india\/story\/pm-modi-addresses-united-nations-first-time-since-india-s-election-to-unsc-10-points-1701724-2020-07-17\">ECOSOC<\/a>, this week, the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi delivered the keynote address at the virtual gathering. This happened to be the second time, that Mr Modi had the opportunity to address the council, as he had delivered the keynote address back when the council was celebrating its 70th anniversary in the year 2015. However, this does happen to be the first opportunity the Prime Minister has had to address the gathering of member nations since India was overwhelmingly elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The summit was themed around Multilateralism post- COVID-19 and the kind of United Nations we need on the 75th anniversary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">During the address, the Prime Minister called for a reformed multilateralism with a reformed United Nations at its centre. He also stressed on India\u2019s motto, \u2018Sabkasaath, Sabkavikaas, Sabkavishwas\u2019, that resonated with the SDG principle of leaving no one behind. The Prime Minister also used this opportunity to reflect on India\u2019s perseverance in improving the socio-economic situation in the country. On that note, he said, \u201cWhile marching forward on the path to development, we are not forgetting our responsibility towards our planet.\u201d In terms of India\u2019s effort in battling the virus, the Prime Minister praised the system in place by commenting, \u201cOur grassroots health system is helping India attain one of the best recovery rates around the world, in the fight against COVID.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">A large majority of the Prime Minister\u2019s speech revolved around International cooperation and India\u2019s role and partnership with the ECOSOC and other international bodies. The present member states, made note of a significant impact on the global SDGs, due to India\u2019s contribution to the improvement of socio-economic conditions and the support it provided to other developing countries. The Prime Minister also focussed on the role of the first responder that India has been carrying out in the region an example of which would be, India\u2019s Operation Sagar, carried out in the Indian Ocean Region to provide both material and medical assistance to countries. Lastly, the Prime Minister spoke about the importance of financial inclusion and the necessity of providing housing and healthcare, by giving the example of the on-going development efforts in India, especially the \u2018Swacch Bharat Abhiyan\u2019 campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Indo-Pak Relation<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Relations between the two neighbours; India and Pakistan experienced a new low in the last few days as the <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/india\/mea-summons-pakistans-charge-daffaires-after-two-indian-officials-go-missing\/articleshow\/76386657.cms\">Charge d&#8217;Affairs<\/a> of Pakistan was summoned by the Indian Government, following an unprovoked ceasefire violation by Pakistani forces on the night of the 17th of July, 2020 in the<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Krishna Ghati Sector in Jammu and Kashmir. Keeping in mind the soaring number of ceasefire violations by Pakistan which have resulted in the death of 21 Indians and have injured close to 94 civilians, has pushed India to strongly condemn the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by the Pakistani forces. The Indian Government has also seized this opportunity to show their contempt at the subvert and continued Pakistani support for cross border terrorist infiltration into India. India has called upon Pakistan to adhere to the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding between the two countries, which requires them both to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control and the international border.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>India Ideas Summit<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.08.17-AM1.jpeg\" alt=\"INDIA\u2019S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT - EDITION #3\" class=\"wp-image-2434\" width=\"622\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.08.17-AM1.jpeg 1280w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.08.17-AM1-300x164.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.08.17-AM1-1024x561.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.08.17-AM1-768x421.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/><figcaption><em>PM Modi addressing India Ideas Summit via video conferencing<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mea.gov.in\/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl\/32841\/PMs_address_at_India_Ideas_Summit_2020\">The India Ideas Summit<\/a>, being organized by the India-US Business Council, which is celebrating its 45th anniversary, had the prime Minister deliver the keynote address.

Minister of External Affairs, Dr S Jaishankar, U.S Secretary of State Mr Mike Pompeo, Senator of Virginia and the co-chair of the Indian Caucus, Mr Mark Warner and the U.S ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Nikki Haley will be among those attending the summit. The summit essentially aims to discuss India-US cooperation and the relations between the two countries in a post COVID world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>India-Spain Foreign Office Consultations<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">India this week was a part of the 6th <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mea.gov.in\/press-releases.htm?dtl\/32843\/IndiaSpain_Foreign_Office_Consultations\">Foreign Office consultation with Spain<\/a>, held on the 21st of July. The Indian delegation was led by Mr Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West). Meanwhile, the Spanish side had, Ms Cristina Gallach, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ibero-America, and the Caribbean, at its helm. The two countries along with discussing reforms and opportunities for enhancing bilateral economic cooperation exchanged views on the COVID 19 response and post- COVID recovery priorities. Lastly, the two sides revised agreements under consideration and mutually agreed to forward the bilateral agenda, including exchange by both sides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Release of Nidan Singh Sachdeva<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 43%\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"962\" height=\"541\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1.jpeg\" alt=\"INDIA\u2019S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT - EDITION #3\" class=\"wp-image-2437 size-full\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1.jpeg 962w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-28-at-12.15.18-AM-1-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was kidnapped last month from the Chamkani district in Pakita province on 22nd June 2020, was recently released from captivity. Nidan Singh belongs to the Hindu-Sikh community of Afghanistan. The Indian Government conveyed its appreciation to the Government of Afghanistan and various tribal leaders of the region for their help. The kidnapping of Nidan Singh has revealed the ongoing targeting and persecution of minority members by terrorists who are controlled by their external supporters. Lastly, in a decisive measure, India has decided to facilitate the return of those minority members who face external security threats.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Even though the country is experiencing a worsening of conditions with its neighbours, keeping in mind the recent development of tensions with Pakistan, over the unprovoked fire at the Line of Control, the country has extended a helping hand towards both nations like Afghanistan in the Middle East and at the same time European nations such as Spain. In the last few years the country has developed military relations with the United States, but in recent times it has looked at the possibility of venturing into developing an economic partnership with the superpower. Lastly, India\u2019s image as developing power worldwide has been further augmented by its election into the United Nations Security Council and the keynote address delivered by the Prime Minister at the Economic and Social Council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also<\/strong>: INDIA\u2019S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/indian-foreign-policy-weekly-report-edition-4\/\">EDITION #4<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy \u2014 In the last week, India has taken substantial strides in its strategic bilateral relations.
