It acts as one economic unit in the world economy and is considered a major world trading power. They are subject to obligation and privileges of the membership. It focuses on comprehensive growth of all countries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Formation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU was formed to end the centuries of warfare that culminated during World War II. The union was founded in 1992 with the Maastricht treaty but was given its reformed structure and powers in 2007 with the Lisbon treaty. Under these treaties, the 27 members agree to come together with their sovereignty and delegate many decision-making powers to the unified body. Currently, there are seven official EU institutions which are made for the executive, judicial and financial functions. The primary aim of this treaty was to boost economic social and political integration amongst the nation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Central Bank is the EU&#8217;s central bank. It regulates monetary policy and manages bank lending rates and foreign exchange reserves. The institution over the&nbsp;years has expanded and strengthened its own authority. It has proved to be a competent institution and is serving its purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, It has also faced a series of unforeseen circumstances including the 2008&nbsp;economic crisis, an influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa and Brexit Negotiations. In June 2016 the United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union and officially from 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Breakdown of the Economy&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most countries that are a part of the European Union and use the same currency Euro. A group of nineteen of the twenty-seven EU members use the Euro currency. Therefore the trade process is simplified and the rest of the EU is also legally required to join the eurozone at some point. In terms of the total value of all the goods and services, it is considered bigger than the US economy. The 19 EU member states that comprise the euro area accounted for 85.5% of the EU\u2019s GDP in 2019. However, due to the unforeseen circumstances implemented across the world in 2020 GDP is down by 3.8% in the euro area and 3.5% in the EU.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU\u2019s trade structure has helped it to become one of the world\u2019s largest economies after China. In 2018 it surpassed China\u2019s GDP with a difference of $3.3 trillion. These measurements use purchasing power parity to the account of discrepancy between each country\u2019s standard of living. Some experts argue that the EU produces more but the US still a larger economy, whereas the US is a country and the EU is a trading area which compiles the 27 countries. Despite the eurozone debt crisis, the EU is staggering towards a bigger fiscal integration. The EU\u2019s currency, the euro has successfully competed with the global currency dollar. The EU&#8217;s exports in 2019 were for products petroleum, automobiles and medication while its top imports are petroleum, communications equipment, and natural gas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Classification of EU Budget<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest chunk of the per cent spent on the agricultural sector. Which includes the direct payment to farmers development of fisheries, forest and rural areas. The second chunk goes into economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is meant to help the EU\u2019s less developed countries. It includes infrastructure, job development, technical assistance for&nbsp;small business. The rest is spent on research and development and building the EU\u2019s foreign policy which is under Global Europe. The EU budget must balance as it has no authority to spend more than it takes in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8211; <strong>Trade<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The 64% trade is undertaken within the EU states. The trade with the rest of the world accounts for some 15.6% of global imports and exports. The EU countries had the second-largest share of global imports and exports of goods in 2016.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>&#8211; <strong>Employability<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After the global economic crisis and eurozone turbulence in 2008, the <a href=\"http:\/\/appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu\/nui\/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-053312_QID_-4AAC19A_UID_-3F171EB0&amp;layout=SEX,L,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;AGE,L,Z,0;UNIT,L,Z,1;TIME,C,Z,2;INDIC_EM,L,Z,3;INDICATORS,C,Z,4;&amp;zSelection=DS-053312INDIC_EM,EMP_LFS;DS-053312AGE,Y15-64;DS-053312TIME,2015;DS-053312UNIT,PC_POP;DS-053312INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;&amp;rankName1=UNIT_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName2=AGE_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName3=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName4=INDIC-EM_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName5=TIME_1_0_0_0&amp;rankName6=SEX_1_2_0_0&amp;rankName7=GEO_1_2_0_1&amp;rStp=&amp;cStp=&amp;rDCh=&amp;cDCh=&amp;rDM=true&amp;cDM=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=ROLLING&amp;time_most_recent=true&amp;cfo=#%23%23,%23%23%23.%23%23%23&amp;lang=en\">employability saw a rise<\/a> in future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br>&#8211; <strong>The Economy Post Covid-19<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world economy has witnessed a plethora of ups and downs in this pandemic. European Union leaders sealed a 750 million \u2013 euro ($857 billion) deal for their coronavirus blighted economies after a marathon talk. The EU was slow to coordinate initially with the pandemic and already weakened by Brexit, It was important for an upfront on economic aid which would demonstrate its come back. Earlier it has been observed bitter rows over how the grants would be managed. Council President Michel said securing a deal as \u201cnot only about money, it\u2019s about people, about the European future, about our unity.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel said on Monday that EU leaders had come up with a &#8220;framework&#8221; for a possible agreement. Whereas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-ca\/money\/topstories\/asian-shares-extend-gains-as-investors-count-on-stimulus-vaccines\/ar-BB16Z13n?li=AAadgLE\">Michel<\/a> told, &#8220;This agreement sends a concrete signal that Europe is a force for action\u201d. French President Emmanuel Macron, who spearheaded the deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hailed it as &#8220;truly historic&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Currently, Countries like France, Spain and smaller nations in the EU have been adversely affected, It is believed that the economies of France and Spain will shrink by over 10%. The Country\u2019s GDP is not expected to return to last year\u2019s level before 2022. Earlier this month that it expects the EU economy to shrink 8.3% in 2020, The European Commission said considerably worse than the 7.4% slump predicted two months ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Comparisons With India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deficiency in India\u2019s COVID relief package is inadequate fiscal spending ( just 1% of GDP). For spending more the government will have to borrow more. However, without spending, the economy will likely struggle a little longer. Whereas in the EU package Euro 390 billion of grants. Cheap loans and credit guarantees are important but for a declining economy, stress should be given more to wage subsidies and emphasis on the MSME sector.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meeting of the EU is the first major in-person gathering of world leaders since the COVID-19. The ideal emphasis which every leader is saying is the concept of \u2018fundamental of the internal market should begin again with all necessary precautions and not just countries most affected by the crisis but also for those which benefit the most from the internal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>European Union (EU) is a political and economic union which consists of 27 member countries.
