A study of the factors leading these changes has often lead us to question the status quo and often shape the world political model. Within a time span of a century, we experienced a magnanimous shift in the way the systems of the world function. The start of the 20th century was marked with the number of states pursuing the policy of isolationism, and at the same time, we perceived Europe as the epicentre of all major political activity and trade. A decade later as the clouds of destruction cleared we saw the world is divided into two blocks, the Soviet Communist Block and the American Capitalist Block. This essentially meant that the entire world was forced to choose sides limiting the possibility of open and fair international trade. With the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, the Soviet empire collapsed, paving the way for the possibility of an integrated international system, powered by the waves of globalisation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Current Situation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Over time, the process was expected to create a robust global economic powered by the mutual economic and social cooperation. However, this expectation soon became a distant concept as the world\u2019s economy struggled to overcome disturbances caused by a number of political and economic setbacks that permanently disturbed the socio-economic fabric of society. Most recent of these events being the novel Coronavirus. The crises we face today is unlike any other we have experienced earlier, forcing us to question the existing international systems, and with that the concept of globalisation. On the other hand, there are those that have come to coin the present situation as, \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/opinions\/2020\/jun\/11\/covid-19-what-is-the-future-of-globalisation-2155073.html\">Globalisation<\/a>\u2019, signalling a return to globalised world post the pandemic. There exists no doubt about the fact that the Globalisation has connected not only industries and business, but it has done away with social, economic and political borders, that has allowed for the free flow of intellect, capital and resources. While this has acted to the benefit of many nations, a number of people have been extremely vocal about the fact that the process has enhanced the vulnerabilities of nations by making them over-dependent on the global supply chain. Loopholes and drawback of this nature have been further highlighted by the COVID 19 pandemic, as underdeveloped and developing nations have been left struggling to meet the demand of essential items such as masks, sanitisers and medicines. In the past few months itself, we have recorded a 13-32% decline in merchandise trade, a 30-40% reduction in FDI and 44-80% reduction in International air travel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Future of Globalisation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Seeing the present situation, that has resulted in a major role back on the gains made by globalisation in the previous two decades and a fundamental collapse of the international market integration, many have come to envision the world in the post-pandemic days. The most obvious answer to these questions seems to be that, leader shave to plan for and shape a world where both globalisation and anti-globalisation pressures remain enduring features of the business environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">It is too early to say, if whether the world is done and dusted with the concept of Globalisation. However, recent statistics and forecasts, predict that the concept should be in currency following the end of the pandemic. However, the nature of the same might be different from what we have experienced previously. The pandemic that had a universal impact, left all national economies in shackles, then whether it be the United States or some of the richest European nations. The economic recovery has been the top priority for all countries. However, such robust economic growth can only be pursued once the pandemic has been brought under control. Viewing the economic trends prior to the pandemic, it is clear that globalisation is an important agent in the growth and health of nations. Countries higher up in the <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/05\/will-covid-19-have-a-lasting-impact-on-globalization\">DHL Global Connectedness Index<\/a> tend to record faster economic growth. There is well-founded evidence to the fact that well-connected countries have a more advanced medical system, making them less susceptible to infectious diseases and put them in a better place to deal with the same. This goes to show that the negatives of globalisation, can just as easily be turned into positive contributions, by investing in health, growth and international cooperation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Global Growth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The COVID 19 pandemic has added fuel to the fire, by further destabilising an already fractured world. The pandemic introduced new levels of complexity, an example of which is the national restrictions and differing government response policies, which have further highlighted the differing ideological grounds. However, it is but natural to assume from here on forth that the global socio-economic environment will be driven more by factors based on regional competition, domestic self-sufficiency and when it comes to transnational companies and organisations, the country of their origin will decide the nature of policies they will adopt. Even as the lockdown restrictions have begun to ease we have seen that short distance and domestic trade have recorded a stronger comeback than international trade, hence the importance of regions should not be underplayed and the possibility of stronger domestic and regional trade flows should not be completely forgone while envisaging a new world order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Technological Advancements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">As the pandemic disrupted the status quo, forcing us to adapt to and adopt new ways, it invariably led to the creation of new technology and adoption of e-commerce, videoconferencing and robotics. Before we were faced with the challenge of dealing with a world pandemic, it was a commonly held belief that strides in technological development may not lead to an increase in global flows. However, recent times are a complete antithesis to that belief, as the cross border, e-commerce has come to expand export opportunities for smaller companies, and forced experimentation with remote work could spur more service offshoring. In planning ahead, for the post-COVID 19 scenario, business leaders have to think creatively by taking a structured approach to consider both internal and external implication. For most companies, technological trends should lead to more globalisation in some areas and less in others, rather than a uniform shift in one direction or the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Public Perception<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Public Opinion towards globalisation has taken a hit, calling back the strong support trends as international trade and immigration had received in the last two decades in particular. The fact that international travel has led to the spread of the virus and the increasing economic stress has resulted in<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/international\/business\/view-coronavirus-pandemic-may-force-world-to-rethink-globalization\/articleshow\/75772248.cms?from=mdr\"> trade protectionism,<\/a> politicians have used this in their favour to consolidate support against globalisation and the evils that it has introduced into our polities. In these uncertain times, citizens and more important customers and employees have turned to corporate leaders to make a statement regarding globalisation. The rise of anti-globalisation and anti-capitalist movements, as the virus spreads globally has further complicated the role of businesses in the public debate about globalisation. The need of hour requires us to focus on the real economic contributions and how they can help support a healthier form of globalisation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">A tremendous challenge lies ahead of us, to transform the current world order by regulating and weakening the burdens of globalisation. As the days have passed it has become clearer to us that we have to create a mechanism to respond to diseases through effective international cooperation, without retreating back to the evil of ethnocentrism. Covid-19 effect on the globalisation can be seen more as a bend, rather than a permanent break. Attention to the drivers of globalisation, can lead and navigate companies through and even profit from the turbulence. It is now that the value of globalisation in the form of international cooperation can be portrayed to ensure a suitable and stable future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every few decades the world undergoes a political and socio-economic transformation.
