Often called the <strong>Land of the Rising Sun<\/strong>, the country is heavily associated with cherry blossom trees (Sakura), anime and manga, Sushi and Ramen, tea ceremonies, etc, pictures of which are often displayed in Japan tourism ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>KYOTO \u2013 THE CULTURAL CENTRE<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">While the rich culture of Japan is prevalent throughout the entire nation, the city of Kyoto in the southwest of the country is regarded as the cultural centre, by the Japanese and foreigners alike, perhaps owing to its historical roots. Kyoto was the capital of the country until the latter half of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, and therefore people often perceive it as the birthplace of the Japanese culture. Home to about 2000 temples and shrines along with imperial palaces, and other ancient buildings, it was within this city that several distinct cultural institutions of Japan, like, <strong>tea ceremony (cha-no-yu)<\/strong> and <strong>flower<\/strong> <strong>arranging (ikebana)<\/strong>,<strong> the theatrical arts of Noh<\/strong>,<strong> Kabuki <\/strong>and <strong>traditional dance<\/strong>, were initiated and spread to other parts of the country. Kyoto also has housed masterpieces of calligraphy, sculpting, painting and architecture. The population in Kyoto still remains involved in such activities, creating masterpieces that are deemed as national treasures, conducting tea ceremonies, and having an active theatrical life with annual processions by Noh performers, etc. The three festivals that the citizens celebrate in great grandeur and pride are <strong>Aoi <\/strong>in May, <strong>Gion<\/strong> in July and <strong>Jidai<\/strong> in October.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"832\" height=\"468\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/3948_02-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2753\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/3948_02-min.jpg 832w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/3948_02-min-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/3948_02-min-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\"><em>Aoi Festiva<\/em>l<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-11-at-11.58.54-PM-min-1024x575.jpeg\" alt=\"JAPANESE CULTURE\" class=\"wp-image-2754\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-11-at-11.58.54-PM-min-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-11-at-11.58.54-PM-min-300x169.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-11-at-11.58.54-PM-min-768x431.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-11-at-11.58.54-PM-min.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\"><em>Gion Festival<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Jidai-Matsuri-03-min-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"JAPANESE CULTURE\" class=\"wp-image-2755\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Jidai-Matsuri-03-min-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Jidai-Matsuri-03-min-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Jidai-Matsuri-03-min-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Jidai-Matsuri-03-min.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\"><em>Jidai Festival<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The Japanese population along with the whole world, has embraced the culture of Kyoto, which can be implied by the recent popularity of the phrase, <strong>\u201cSekai no Kyoto\u201d<\/strong> (The World\u2019s Kyoto). The popular tourist destinations like the many number of Shrines and temples (Fushimi Inari Shrine, Gingaku \u2013 Ji Temple, Kinkaku \u2013 Ji temple, etc ), the Arashiyama Bamboo grove, and others such as Gion and Pont-cho street attract tourists from all over the world, and even the native Japanese who try to go to the city atleast once in their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>RELIGION \u2013 Buddhism and Shintoism<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Japan has seen the growth of two major religions, i.e, Buddhism which was brought about by foreign forces and the native religion of Shintoism, both of which have peacefully co-existed. However, the &nbsp;division between followers of Buddhism and Shintoism is far from watertight, as most often, those Japanese who follow Buddhism, sometimes also declare themselves as followers of Shinto.

There are no historical evidences that suggest the identity of the founder of the religion, and a lack of sacred texts and any sort of formalized teachings, indicate the fact that unlike Buddhism, it\u2019s not an organized religion. The cornerstone of Shintoism is the belief in <a href=\"https:\/\/thetruejapan.com\/shinto-a-look-into-the-religion-of-japan\/\">Kami<\/a>, i.e, the spiritual elements of nature that exist in waterways, trees, mountains, and geographical regions. &nbsp;The only foundation of the religion in conclusion is therefore, reverence of peace and harmony, respect for all elements of nature and the belief that being in nature means a closer access to Kami.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How has Buddhism influenced Japanese culture?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-12.21.33-AM-min-1024x822.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2759\" width=\"461\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-12.21.33-AM-min-1024x822.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-12.21.33-AM-min-300x241.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-12.21.33-AM-min-768x617.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-12.21.33-AM-min.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>The Great Buddha (Daibutsu) at K\u014dtoku-in, Kamakura, in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buddhism which officially came to Japan around 525 BC, has been able to acquire a large following in the country, with about 90 million of the population identifying themselves as Buddhists. While the religion faced a certain conflict between pro-Buddhist and anti-Buddhism factions, it was successful in establishing its foundations in Japan and subsequently changed the political structure, technological fields and brought in a myriad of sophisticated cultural practices like dance, music, a new writing system and also Buddhist art, that have undoubtedly had a greater impact on the Japanese culture as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>\u2018<em>Matsuri<\/em>\u2019 \u2013 THE CULTURAL FESTIVALS OF JAPAN<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">A very important and lively aspect of Japanese culture, is the many number of \u2018<strong>matsuri\u2019<\/strong> or the cultural festivals, which bring in cheerful spirits for the native population, who often enjoy the festivities wearing colourful and mostly, traditional clothes and getting involved in the activities the festivals are known for. Research suggests that Japan witnesses as many as 200-300 festivals in a year, all of which are big, fun and crowded events, and are deeply entrenched within the Japanese Culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">These festivals which occur over the course of a year, differ greatly in terms of the season in which they occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>SUMMER<\/strong>: The festivals in summer are known worldwide for their use of fireworks or what the Japanese call, <strong>Hanabi<\/strong>.

Both Anime and Manga, over the years have become a very crucial aspect of Japanese culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-1.06.49-AM-min1-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"JAPANESE CULTURE\" class=\"wp-image-2769\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-1.06.49-AM-min1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-1.06.49-AM-min1-300x169.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-1.06.49-AM-min1-768x432.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-1.06.49-AM-min1.jpeg 1211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Still from Grave of the Fireflies<\/em> <em>(1980)<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/cd4fa5d9b6541b9df431ed82d5ecf0c7.jpg\" alt=\"JAPANESE CULTURE\" class=\"wp-image-2766\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/cd4fa5d9b6541b9df431ed82d5ecf0c7.jpg 640w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/cd4fa5d9b6541b9df431ed82d5ecf0c7-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Manga Comic<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The <strong>unconventionality <\/strong>associated with anime and manga, is perhaps a contributor to it\u2019s popularity among adults, and not just kids. These stories that are available in all genres like action, romance, slice of life, rom-com, supernatural, horror, etc, break the notion that anime is meant only for kids. The fan base remain hooked on each episode or chapter, due to the unpredictability of what might happen next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">In Japan, anime and Manga, has become a way of life for <strong>\u2018Otakus\u2019<\/strong> (which however is an offensive word for the Japanese) a term used for those hardcore fans of these elements, to the extent that they give up their social lives and withdraw into their homes watching anime and playing video games. The emotional attachment to these forms of entertainment becomes evident when numerous instances of funerals held for anime characters come into light. But anime in Japan is not only limited to the private sphere. It\u2019s presence is abundant everywhere, on trains, buses, advertisements, etc. Moreover, anime and manga also provide a deep insight into Japanese culture, in both covert and overt ways. Most animes have episodes dedicated to the cultural festivals, fireworks, cherry blossoms, otaku culture, Japanese way of living, tea ceremonies and so on. The town of <strong>Akihabara<\/strong> near Tokyo, is believed to be the Anime centre, the streets of which are lined with numerous anime shops selling anime merchandise of various kinds. There are also many themed cafes like maid and butler cafes, which attract a lot of tourists. Even outside Akihabara, it is not uncommon to find many huge or life-size statues that give tribute to anime characters and their creators. Anime themed parks, which are a sight of awe for tourists as well as the natives are also abundant in Japan, the most famous of them being the Naruto theme park, Attack on Titans theme park, etc. Often, streets of Japan are also lined with cosplayers, impersonating characters from famous animes. In fact, cosplaying is also an important part of Japanese culture, which has immense importance, as evident by the numerous cosplay competitions held throughout the nation. Anime conventions are also likely events in Japan which are attended by Anime fans from Japan and all over the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>TRADITIONAL ARCHITECTURE, CUISINE AND ATTIRE<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Traditional Japanese Architecture is attributed to a distinct aesthetic, that can be attributed to some unique characteristics used in the making of these homes. The dominant feature of traditional Japanese homes is <strong>wood<\/strong>, that is preferred in the making of the house over other materials such as stone, perhaps owing to the unpredictability brought about by earthquakes. Wood is respected by the Japanese to the extent that the wood in homes remain in their natural forms and is not concealed by paint. The doors in these houses are fusuma, or sliding doors while the windows are movable screens (shoji). The floors in Japanese houses are covered with tatami mats, made with straw, that along with the wood provides a distinct smell to the traditional Japanese houses. Outside the houses, are what may be called verandahs, which are a wooden extension to the house, which are often elevated from the ground, sometimes covered with shutters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Japanese cuisine basically comprises of regional and traditional foods, and primarily focuses on combining <strong>steamed rice (gohan<\/strong>) which is their staple with one or more main and side dishes and <strong>miso soup <\/strong>or pickles.
