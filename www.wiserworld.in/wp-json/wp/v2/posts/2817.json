At the time, India\u2019s territories, especially that of the Kushan Empire, reached up to the frontiers of the Central Asian plateau. This geographic relationship continued further until the 16th century when the Mughal reign had begun in India. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/mea.gov.in\/Portal\/ForeignRelation\/Uzbekistan_Jan_2017.pdf\">historical research<\/a>, economically, not only did Central Asian cities \u2013 such as Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara \u2013 play an important role in the Silk Road connecting India with China and Europe, but also Indian merchants based in the region formed an integral part of the local economies. Furthermore, the cultural relationship was extended on other aspects as well. This can be seen in the spread of Buddhism from the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia and the ideas of Sufism reaching India therefrom.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/carnegieindia.org\/2019\/12\/01\/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576\">Observations<\/a> have shown that with the onset of the Age of Discovery in Europe, increased interest of Russia and China in Central Asia somewhat led to the breaking away of India\u2019s connections with the region. Even after Independence, India\u2019s foreign policy majorly focused on its immediate neighbours, or solidarity-based relations with the African countries, or even robust economic ties with Russia &#8212; but, the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent and the distancing of the region geographically did play a role in the deterioration of the relations with the region from India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Further, in the post-Cold War era, after the Soviet Union split Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the 1990s, India took upon the task of developing its relations with the resource-rich region while also undertaking its own domestic economic reforms of bringing about liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation. Former Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited four out of the five republics \u2013 Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 1993, followed by Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan in 1995. In addition to the collective values that India shared with the countries, collective development and economic growth, as well as formulating approached to combating common threats such as terrorism, religious extremism, and crime that these nations shared with India. A few <a href=\"https:\/\/carnegieindia.org\/2019\/12\/01\/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576\">experts<\/a> also believe that the stage which was set by these conversations was even reflected in India\u2019s Look North policy of recent times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Despite the historical links with the Central Asian Economies and India moving quickly to establish diplomatic ties with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan after their emergence as independent countries almost three decades ago, trade has not grown beyond $2 billion, with them. In recent years, foreign-affairs analysts have begun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orfonline.org\/research\/india-and-china-in-central-asia-understanding-the-new-rivalry-in-the-heart-of-eurasia-61473\/#_edn6\">observing<\/a> what they call the \u201cNew Great Game\u201d in Central Asia &#8212; Russia, the US, European Union (EU), China, Turkey, Iran and India are all trying to assert their power and hegemony in the region. Not only does the region provide for a large market, but it also has prospects for developing hydropower, fossil fuel resources, and other lucrative prospects. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orfonline.org\/research\/india-and-china-in-central-asia-understanding-the-new-rivalry-in-the-heart-of-eurasia-61473\/#_edn3\">experts<\/a>, India, for its part, has so far chosen to take the \u2018constructivist\u2019 approach. This entails a strategy of, interests are not solely based on economic or strategic benefits but attempt to involve an intersectional and even culture-oriented involvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Current Developments<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">India\u2019s continued interest in Central Asia can be attributed to the geopolitical relevance of the region due to three factors &#8212; Chinese presence and influx in the region through its expansionist infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a continued historical context of Russia\u2019s dominance in the region, and the overall regional security dynamic. Keeping these in mind, India had unveiled its Connect Central Asia Policy in Bishkek in 2012 in order to draw attention to the expansion of the region\u2019s economic interests in congruence with India\u2019s plans of integrating its external neighbourhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The lack of connectivity of India with the region of Central Asia has been a long withstanding issue in this context. For instance, the long-delayed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, backed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), was first proposed in the mid-1990s and all four actors officially signed an intergovernmental agreement in 2010. But, since then, the project has been stalled due to the status of Afghanistan and mistrust between India and Pakistan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">To combat this connectivity gap, India has undertaken positive action in the past as well quite recently. India, Iran and Russia signed the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) agreement which aimed to offer connectivity between India and Central Asia through Iran. As is noted by this <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/carnegieindia.org\/2019\/12\/01\/realizing-india-s-strategic-interests-in-central-asia-pub-80576\" target=\"_blank\">resource<\/a>, while the INSTC is routed via Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port, India has also explored the possibility of connecting with Central Asia via Iran\u2019s Chabahar port and thereafter overland corridors passing through Afghanistan. The importance bestowed by India to the Chabahar port, despite the uncertainties which the US-Iran tensions bring to the conversation, can be accorded by the budgetary allocation to the project, which is amounting to INR 1 Billion in 2020-21 announcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Way Forward<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Since China has been able to leverage its geography, finances and population to ensure that its projects can contribute toward making its dream of a new and improved Silk Road a reality, India is also committed to expanding the scope of its economic relations with the region. India has immense potential in developing small and medium scale industries in the region which is presently being provided through India\u2019s program of ITEC (Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation). The ITEC programme covers information technology, management, journalism, diplomacy, entrepreneurship, and banking. New Delhi also signed the Strategic Partnership Agreements (SPA) with three of the five nations of the Central Asian Economies &#8212; Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan &#8212; in order to stimulate defence cooperation and deepen trade relations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">As a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kommersant.ru\/doc\/3984235\">report <\/a>in a Russian newspaper observed, \u201cIndian presence in the region should balance the growing Chinese influence and prevent it from becoming the region of Beijing\u2019s undivided dominance.\u201d This idea can be brought to effect by India by leveraging its membership at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">India and the Central Asian Economies can prioritize energy, pharmaceuticals, automotive, agro-processing, education, urban infrastructure and transport, civil aviation, IT and tourism sectors to strengthen economic links. The Central Asian economies and India have had a long history of association which can be efficiently revived to mutual benefit by the means of strategic and economic cooperation and connectivity, both notions that can be leveraged by the stakeholders in a post-pandemic world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The strategic and economic ties between India and Central Asia can be traced back to the era of the Silk Road, which facilitated the flux of ideas in the Asian region.
