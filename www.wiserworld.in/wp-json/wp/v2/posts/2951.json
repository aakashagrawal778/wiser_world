Day by day the crime rates are increasing and newspapers and media reports from all across the globe are flooding us with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/juvenile-justice-system-in-india\/\">news of violence, delinquency and crime<\/a>. What is even more alarming is the rate in which Juveniles are being involved in delinquent acts and are committing violent offences. However, it is through the lens of crime that one get\u2019s to see the underlying cracks and faults of society.

Generally, the theories are grouped as biological or physiological, psychological and sociological. While genetic composition, personality dynamics and neuropsychological processing play a major causal role in juvenile delinquency, the contribution of the social environment of the child and other sociological factors cannot be ignored or neglected. Growing up in a non-supportive environment and a world full of crime, bullying, violent video games and TV shows, prejudices and hate crimes and domestic violence &#8211; all negatively impact the mindset and attitude of children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE MAJOR SOCIOLOGICAL CAUSES <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FAMILY <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/scholars.unh.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=perspectives\">Family<\/a> is one of the most basic and fundamental units of society.

Their study revealed that middle children are more prone to engaging in criminal activities because they are likely to get less care and attention from their parents in comparison to their older or younger siblings. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, all of the above mentioned factors may directly or indirectly lead a child to fall in bad company and consequently indulge in offensive activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>SCHOOLS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to family, schools, religious institutions and community play an important part in the process of socialisation of a child. <a href=\"https:\/\/shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in\/bitstream\/10603\/145628\/7\/07_chapter3.pdf\">School<\/a> is where children spend a maximum of their time and have closest contacts and interactions with most children. Schools impart academic knowledge and provide moral and value education to children. The modern school systems put a strong emphasis on a good performance and thus create an environment of competition. However, children who are intellectually, economically, emotionally or socially deprived may face difficulty in meeting their expectations and are likely to resort to unfair means or delinquent acts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>PEERS<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Family and parents have the responsibility of teaching socially acceptable values to children. When these values are not imparted, a child\u2019s bond with parents and school is broken, causing deterioration in their academic performance. As a consequence, children may start associating with deviant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2747364\/\">peer groups<\/a> in which they feel accepted. These peer groups then pressurise or encourage children or adolescents to begin or continue engaging in deviant actions. Peer groups or \u201cgangs\u201d usually play the role of conveying techniques of delinquency, providing training in delinquency, safeguarding the members of the gang engaged in deviant acts and maintaining a continuity of delinquent actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>MEDIA AND CINEMA<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s technology-driven world, there is no limit to the material that can be accessed with the click of a button. From a very young age, children are exposed to cartoons, TV series, movies and video games. While watching action-packed blockbusters casting our favourite actors or superheroes can be a thrilling and exciting experience for us, several researchers have found that television, comic books, movies, radio and video games portraying violence and sexual acts or highlighting crimes are significant factors contributing to juvenile delinquency. Children are easily attracted by these kinds of contents and often times they want to imitate in their real-life what they watched on screen. Thus, <a href=\"https:\/\/phdessay.com\/media-and-juvenile-delinquency\/\">media influence<\/a> and the subsequent information explosion may be one of the growing causes of delinquency in children and adolescents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides these, there are several other social factors like poor living conditions in neighbourhood and the frequency in which crimes happen, poor recreation facilities, love adventures, the bad company of friends, excessive rigidity in society and poor socio-economic conditions of the society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HOW CAN ONE PREVENT JUVENILE DELINQUENCY?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding juvenile delinquency and tackling it is complex. To prevent deviant behaviours from appearing or developing, parents, teachers, caregivers and other authority figures must use effective discipline, monitoring and different problem-solving techniques (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01639620802589806\">Crosswhite and Kerpelman 2008<\/a>).&nbsp; The first step of preventing deviance is recognising deviant behaviours and keeping track of when they occur. Punishments given for maintaining effective discipline must neither be overly harsh nor extremely negligible because that might have a counter effect on the child and chances of deviancy may therefore increase. Monitoring means having an awareness of the child\u2019s whereabouts, who their peers are and what they do in their leisure time. Problem-solving skills are essential in a child\u2019s development of communication. A lack of problem-solving skills and communication can cause children to shrug off responsibilities, behave in a defensive manner and make them more aggressive. Parents should therefore consciously practice positive parenting by constantly supporting and reinforcing their child\u2019s pro-social behaviours and strengthening the parent-child bond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0743558401164006\">Research<\/a> shows that children and adolescents with positive attitudes and feelings toward their school are less likely to be deviant. Thus, schools should encourage the development of a healthy and positive environment in which the students feel valued, loved and accepted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"603\" height=\"602\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-61.png\" alt=\"JUVENILE\n\n\" class=\"wp-image-2953\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-61.png 603w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-61-300x300.png 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-61-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Children are like clay in potter&#8217;s hands.
