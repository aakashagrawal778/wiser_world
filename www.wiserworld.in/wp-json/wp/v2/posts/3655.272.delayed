Not only have we been dealing with an existential crisis at hand in the form of the COVID 19 pandemic, but as we step into a new decade of the 21st century, we find chaos and confusion governing the four corners of the world, with the coups in countries like Mali and the pitiable state that countries like Nigeria are in. However, the most anticipated event of the year, the US presidential elections are in a fortnight, and it\u2019ll definitely be interesting to see how they shape global politics in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> INDIAN FOREIGN POLICY REPORT \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/indian-foreign-policy-report-edition-6\/\">EDITION #6<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overview of the Indian Foreign Policy&nbsp;\u2014 The piping tensions between the two neighbours, India and China were further cooled with the country taking part in the India-China Military Commander-Level Meeting, which resulted in the issuing of a joint press release.
