The two-week-long war has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of fellow countrymen while forcing close to 30,000 refugees to flee to neighbouring Sudan. <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5898498\/what-happens-next-in-ethiopias-political-turmoil\/\">Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed<\/a>, who took over the reins of power, becoming the youngest African Leader, released a statement highlighting that the Ethiopian forces have launched an attack against the TPLF after he accused them of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Current State<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Abiy\u2019s government that refused to comment in the early stages of the conflict, recently asserted that its troops have successfully conquered territories, winning key battles, and are now marching undeterred towards Mekelle, where the TPLF has a stronghold and battle-hardened history. The war has pitted the central government against one of the most heavily militarized states that constitute Ethiopia. The TPLF occupied the helm of power for a long time within the Ethiopian political system, up until power was assumed by the current Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed two years ago. While commenting on its recent actions the government claimed that the TPLF has turned renegade and is holding power in Tigray illegally, while both sides have blamed the other for an unconstitutional assault on rights, and creating a situation that has stirred up a global humanitarian situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Countries in the African region in the past week have expressed their concern that the current situation could set off a spark that may result in an all-out civil war, which could play a highly destabilizing role, affecting the Horn of Africa, which is the continents most fragile regions. The Tigray who leaders have been blamed for plotting against the government and subsequently purchasing heavy machinery in an effort to prepare for a war with Ahmed\u2019s government have voiced their discontent with the central government, in saying that the Tigray population has been unfairly treated, ousted from top government jobs while being used a scapegoat for Ethiopia\u2019s failures under the current administration. In an attempt to break free of the autocratic shackles of the government, Tigray held its elections in September in defiance of Abiy\u2019s government. However, the following move did not yield the results that the Tigray leaders were expecting, instead, it acted to bolster the belief of Abiy Ahmed\u2019s government, towards the need to bring the entire region under their control, leading them to vote in favor of establishing a temporary government in the region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Refugee Crisis<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the war continues an obvious result of the instability and uncertainty has been the increasing number of Ethiopian citizens fleeing the conflict in the Northern region of the country and moving into Sudan. With numbers reaching close to 10,000, aid officials providing services on the ground believe that the numbers are going to significantly increase in the coming days. The gravity of the situation and the poor conditions prevalent in the region were described by the Sajjad<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohammad Sajid, the United Nations Humanitarian Chief in Ethiopia, in what he described as long lines appearing outside bread shops of hungry children and women, while supply laden trucks are stuck at the border. Considering that such movement of refugees hasn\u2019t been recorded in the region in the last two decades, and also recognizing the lack of resources in the hands of governments, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees has issued an official warning for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/uk\/news\/briefing\/2020\/11\/5fb391214\/pace-ethiopian-refugee-arrivals-sudan-unseen-decades.html\">humanitarian crisis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 27,000 have now crossed into Sudan through the Hamdayet border in Kassala State, the Lugdi in Gedaref State, and a new location further south at Aderafi border where Ethiopian refugees started crossing over the weekend. Recent ground reports indicate that refugees have been pouring into Sudan, exhausted from the long trek. The UNHCR along with partner agencies is moving to support the Sudanese government in its response, ramping up humanitarian assistance at the borders as the need continues to grow at an exponential rate. In the last week itself, the UNHCR has relocated close to 2,500 refugees, and with this constant and immediate need to keep relocating refugees, there seemed to have emerged a shortage of spaces or sites where these vulnerable refugees can be relocated to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Tigray, the lack of electricity, telecommunication, and no access to food and cash has been a major roadblock in delivering humanitarian assistance in the region. After nearly two weeks of conflict, reports of larger numbers of internally displaced grow daily, while the lack of access to those in need, coupled with the inability to move goods to the region, remain major impediments to providing assistance. The current Ethiopian crisis has been a major cause for the Eritrean refugee population of nearly 100,00 in Tigray, who are majorly reliant on assistance from UNHCR and partners. The potential for further <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/nov\/11\/thousands-of-refugees-cross-into-sudan-to-flee-fighting-in-ethiopia\">displacement of refugees<\/a> inside the country is increasingly a real possibility. The humanitarian situation as a result of this crisis is growing rapidly. UNHCR reiterates its call for peace and urges all parties to respect the safety and security of all civilians in Tigray.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What next?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic and the postponement of the general elections acted as a blessing for the Ethiopian government, who were able to use these unusual circumstances to sideline opposition leaders while also cracking down on critics, and most importantly producing an election environment that they can be comfortable with. For now, it seems, that Ahmed\u2019s government will try and keep a lid on future confrontations with the Tigray leaders, while simultaneously try and curtail the budget of the region, in an attempt to squeeze out, what the government has termed as a rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Featured Image Source<\/strong>: Google Images | Image By: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DO8tXKVKXryg&amp;psig=AOvVaw2CtL__nLxQTx4f5rLmvie-&amp;ust=1606364370981000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAMQjB1qFwoTCNiijOLrnO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAs\">CSIS<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ethiopian government in a recent conflict that erupted in the country has found itself grinding horns with the Tigray population.
