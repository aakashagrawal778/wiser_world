One such horrifying experience is that of genital mutilation. It\u2019s an extremely gender-based traditional practice that a lot of us are not familiar with. The term Female Genital Mutilation (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/female-genital-mutilation-fgm-in-some-arab-countries\/\">FGM<\/a>) which is sometimes referred to as female circumcision or female genital cutting is a terminology currently used by the United Nations (UN) agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify the\u00a0ritual cutting\u00a0or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. As painful as it sounds it is also very agonizing to explore the details of it where just a small opening is left to allow urine and menstrual blood to pass. This type is intended to ensure that a girl is a virgin at the time of marriage because virginity is valued more than a woman\u2019s health in such communities. There are a lot of countries where this practise is prevalent, few very openly and most of them very discretely. It is found that in Africa, South-East Asia and the Middle East female genital mutilation is practised abundantly. Here, the transition from being a child to being an adult is often celebrated as \u201ccoming of age ceremonies\u201d or rites of passage to womanhood and limited girls&#8217; human rights in the sense of violating their bodily integrity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been brought to notice terms related to female genital mutilation have been used interchangeably in the past and one such term was \u201cfemale circumcision\u201d that was used because the surgery bore some resemblance to male circumcision. This not only raised questions about the term but also the misleading comparison made with male circumcision. Male circumcision involves removing only part of the foreskin of the penis without impairing sexual function. Male circumcision was carried out to avoid infections and make men superior to women, even with regard to having sexual intercourse. On the other hand, women were forced to undergo such surgery for curbing sexual desires, not keeping in mind the infections and the consequences. This practice experienced by girls is called \u2018Clitorectomy\u2019 or \u2018Clitoridectomy\u2019 where partial or complete clitoris or even parts of the labia are removed surgically with lifelong side effects, and significant health and sexual impairment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Origin<\/strong> of Female Genital Mutilation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we look back and try to trace the origin of female genital mutilation, a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.28toomany.org\/blog\/what-are-the-origins-and-reasons-for-fgm-blog-by-28-too-manys-research-coordinator\/\">researches <\/a>that were held clearly denote that it existed before Islam and Christianity came into being. Some researchers have traced it back to Egypt (5<sup>th<\/sup> Century BC) on the west coast of the Red Sea. There were a few more dots that could be joined to be more assertive about this statement like the Greek papyrus in the British Museum (163 BC) which clearly showed signs of Egyptian mummies of women who went through such surgeries. Strabo, a Greek geographer, on his visit to Egypt in 25 BC reported that circumcision of girls was a tradition widely followed amongst Egyptians. They even gave it an identity of its own by calling it the \u201cEgyptian style\u201d. Curiously, today FGM is referred to as \u201cPharaonic circumcisions\u201d in Sudan and \u201cSudanese circumcision\u201d in Egypt!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Four Broad Categories of Female Genital Mutilation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the establishment of its internationally accepted definition came the differentiation. Hence WHO classified female genital mutilation into&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/data.unicef.org\/topic\/child-protection\/female-genital-mutilation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four broad categories<\/a>&nbsp;in 1995 and again in 2007.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>First<\/strong>: Partial or total removal of the clitoris.<\/li><li><strong>Second<\/strong>: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora.<\/li><li><strong>Third<\/strong>: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice by cutting and creating a seal, with or without excision of the clitoris.<\/li><li><strong>Fourth<\/strong>: Every other harmful procedure of the female genitalia for non-medical purposes like pricking, piercing, and scraping.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1-936x1024.png\" alt=\"Different categories of Female Genital Mutilation\" class=\"wp-image-3815\" width=\"559\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1-936x1024.png 936w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1-274x300.png 274w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1-768x840.png 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1-1170x1280.png 1170w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/1200px-FGC_Types.svg-min-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" \/><figcaption><em>Different types of Female Genital Mutilation<\/em> | Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Female_genital_mutilation_in_the_United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Today\u2019s Scenario<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even today as we speak of female genital mutilation we try coming in terms with reality and how gruesome the nature of this ancient practice can be that is still being carried out largely. Looking at the brighter side of the story we find many groups and organizations that have come together to work and eradicate this practice. They purposely made it a point to not refer to it as &#8220;Female genital cutting&#8221; out of respect for women who have undergone the ritual and do not wish to consider themselves mutilated. It is a highly sensitive issue and no woman wants to feel worse about it than it already is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Female genital cutting is still <a href=\"http:\/\/reproductiverights.org\/document\/female-genital-mutilation-fgm-legal-prohibitions-worldwide#:~:text=FGM%20is%20prevalent%20in%20about,compared%20to%2028%25%20in%20Senegal.\">prevalent <\/a>in about&nbsp;28 African countries, and among a few minority groups in Asia, affecting from 1% of women in countries like Uganda and Cameroon to about 98% of women in other countries such as Sudan. These practices might differ from country to country but the sole motive remains the same, some face limited or controlled forms of cutting in countries like Sierra Leone and others face extreme forms of surgery like Somali regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Female genital cutting is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.equalitynow.org\/the_law_and_fgm\">illegal<\/a> in at least 26 of the 28 African countries in which it is practiced, and it has also been made illegal in several industrialized countries where immigrants or refugees from Africa may reside. FGM has no positive health values attached to it but its prevalence proves the value of women being closely intertwined with this tradition. A large number of girls drop out of schools after this procedure as education and schooling is not seen as a necessary part of their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-1024x520.jpg\" alt=\"Female genital mutilation laws by country map\" class=\"wp-image-3802\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-1024x520.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-300x152.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-768x390.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-1536x780.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-2048x1040.jpg 2048w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Female_genital_mutilation_laws_by_country_map-min-1170x594.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"585\" height=\"151\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-27-File-Female-genital-mutilation-laws-by-country-map-svg-Wikimedia-Commons-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3805\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-27-File-Female-genital-mutilation-laws-by-country-map-svg-Wikimedia-Commons-1.png 585w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-27-File-Female-genital-mutilation-laws-by-country-map-svg-Wikimedia-Commons-1-300x77.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:14px\"><em>Female genital mutilation laws by country map<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>India\u2019s Dawoodi Bohra Community<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right when we think India is not one of those countries that we look down upon for practicing female genital mutilation we realise it very much is! Such cruel practices happen not only in tribal societies or distant places like Africa but also by the Dawoodi Bohra community right here in our country. Young girls aged six and seven are regularly having to go through the unbearable pain of such surgeries without realising the impact that it leaves on women, both physically as well as mentally. About two million people belong to India\u2019s Bohra community and between\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/scroll.in\/article\/962307\/if-sudan-can-ban-female-genital-mutilation-why-cant-india\" target=\"_blank\">75-80%\u00a0<\/a>of Bohra women are subject to female genital mutilation. The colloquial word for female genital mutilation inflicted on girls is\u00a0<em>\u2018khafz\u2019<\/em>. The practice is kept secret and hidden from the public eye and media to keep it away from debates, disagreements, and criticisms. The mothers and grandmothers are usually at the epicentre of it to ensure that this practice continues decade after decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India does not as yet have a specific set of laws that criminalize FGM, mainly because the government&nbsp;still <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/msmagazine.com\/2020\/03\/31\/can-you-deny-my-lived-experience-of-fgm\/\" target=\"_blank\">denies<\/a> the existence&nbsp;of the practice knowing quite well about what goes on behind closed doors. Despite provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences(PoCSO), the tradition has prevailed for decades together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, myth-busting or a new law would not mean that all girls are safe. Almost all graphs and surveys fail to capture the real number of women who are subject to gruesome experiences as most of them are not allowed to even have an opinion about it and speak openly about it either. Changing a law alone cannot end the deeply entrenched practices, neither can it tackle questions about whether it can really legislate changes or not. It is often warned that any attempt to challenge such social and religious norms could incite a backlash or outlawing the practice would only drive it underground. As societies become more urban and industrialized, changes take place and bring in new pressures, pressures that require individuals and such communities to re-examine age-old beliefs, question traditional roles and reconsider established priorities with the view to make this world a better place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Reference(s)<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Murray, A., 2013. <em>From Outrage To Courage<\/em>.
