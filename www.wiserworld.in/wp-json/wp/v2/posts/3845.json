However, this was not the only event which made headlines. The news of Azerbaijan and Armenia inking a peace agreement, brokered mainly by the Russian Federation, grabbed the attention of the world. The waves of terrorism witnessed in the European States were another feature of what today can be defined as the new normal which the world seems to be being forced to accept. However, shrouded by this mist of uncertainty and amidst what can only be termed as anxious times, India has chosen to set out on a path of rebuilding its international relations in the post-COVID-19 world. This is highly evident through not only its participation but the active role it is playing in establishing a dialogue between nations that are a part of platforms such as the ASEAN and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>15th East Asia Summit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15th round of the <a href=\"https:\/\/asean.org\/chairmans-statement-15th-east-asia-summit\/\">East Asia Summit<\/a> was held on the 14th of November.

The External Affairs Minister used the platform to reaffirm the importance of the East Asia Summit, while speaking about the need to adhere to international laws, respecting territorial integrity, and promoting a rule-based global order. His comments tie into India\u2019s recent experience of a border skirmish with its Eastern neighbor, and at the same time, his comments shed light on the country\u2019s plans. The importance that the Indo-Pacific holds for the Indian Subcontinent, was evident by Jaishankar\u2019s remarks, where he referred to the region as an integrated and organic maritime space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaishankar further expressed concerns about actions and decisions in the South China Sea that have led to an erosion of trust. While talking further about the South China Sea, he called for a joint initiative post the COVID 19 pandemic to tackle the challenges cutting across international boundaries such as terrorism, climate change, and the pandemic. Lastly, the discussion moved to the issue that the world has been continuously grappling with. Jaishankar in his remarks about the COVID 19 briefed the EAS leaders about India\u2019s response to the pandemic and highlighted India\u2019s efforts to support the international community. All nations present at the summit issued a joint call to keep all global supply chains open for an expeditious and sustainable economic recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>17th ASEAN Summit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>India was represented at the <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/politics-and-nation\/view-17th-asean-india-summit-a-turning-point-of-asean-india-relations-in-post-covid-world\/articleshow\/79173959.cms\">ASEAN<\/a> by Prime Minister, Mr. Modi.

With there being a constant mention of the shared problem of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent news coming out regarding the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine, achieving 90% and 94.5% effectiveness, the country would have to focus on both production and distribution of the same if it is approved. Lastly, the next few months or even the coming years will be marked by a constant struggle aimed at economic recovery. It will be interesting to see how India\u2019s strategic diplomatic ties help the country get back on its feet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last three weeks have been a roller coaster ride for individuals around the world, as the United States went in for an election and the outcome of Joe Biden\u2019s victory has resulted in a complete and monumental mess.
