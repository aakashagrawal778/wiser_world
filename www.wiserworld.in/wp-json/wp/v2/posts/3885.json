Once she makes up her own mind then she has to prepare her husband and her children and her family. Once she has overcome all these obstacles and applies for the ticket then the male aspirants against whom she is applying makeup all sorts of stories about her. And after all, this when her name goes to the party bosses, they do not select her name because they fear losing that seat&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The above quote of late Sushma Swaraj gives a glimpse of reality that how women have to face so many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/why-do-women-not-go-into-politics\/\">problems and criticisms<\/a> while entering politics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since pre-independence to till now it has been seen that women are always marginalized in the mainstream of politics and in decision making as well as in getting an important position in the political organization and also in our society. But it has been seen that men and women also played an equal role for the development of the nation, they have worked shoulder to shoulder in pre-independent as well as in post-independent India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian constitution is one of the strongest law that provides equal opportunity to both men and women in socio-economic and political aspects. But our societal norms, customs and patriarchal set up treated them as subordinate to men. Their financial dependency upon men also keeps them away from political activities or affiliations. United Nation&#8217;s 2008 survey shows that India marked the lowest number of women&#8217;s participation in parliament i.e. 9.1%. Even a country like UAE marked better than India in the perspective of women&#8217;s participation in parliament i.e. 22.5%. It was seen that the 15th Lok Sabha election has recorded 59 women as a member of parliament highest since independence. India ranked 148 out of the 193 nations with 11.48 percent women in the lower house and 11 percent in the upper house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Government Initiatives and Constitutional Provisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/education-today\/gk-current-affairs\/story\/women-s-reservation-bill-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-bill-which-is-yet-to-be-passed-in-lok-sabha-1653451-2020-03-07\">Women&#8217;s Reservation Bill<\/a> which allows 33% of reservation for women in the elected bodies but the bill is still reserved in the Lok Sabha after it was passed from the Rajya Sabha. As it has been already stated that the constitution provides equal opportunity to all citizens of India, the constitution also called the state to take measure to neutralize the socio-economic, political, educational and political disadvantages faced by women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Article 14<\/strong> &#8211; It guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of law within the territory of India.<\/li><li><strong>Article 39(b)<\/strong> &#8211; has provision for equal pay for equal work for both men and women.<\/li><li><strong>Article 325 and 326<\/strong> &#8211; They guarantee political equality equal right to participation in political activity and right to vote respectively.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Success Stories of Indian Women in Politics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many stories of success of Indian women in ancient, medieval as well as in the modern period. It is believed that administration and politics both are the arenas of men. However, in India, we have seen that many women have played and are still playing an important role in both the above-mentioned areas. Late Indira Gandhi has served the nation as the first PM of India and her daughter in law Mrs Sonia Gandhi is the present president of Indian National Congress and was the former chairperson of UPA. The first Indian to serve as the President of the United Nations General Assembly was a woman, Vijay Lakshmi Pandit. States like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir have had women as a chief minister in past. The highest decision making of CPI(M) i.e. Polit Bureau has two women representative out of its thirteen members body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we compare between two foremost national parties INC and BJP in respect of giving the nomination to female candidates, it shows that INC nominates more female candidates than BJP. It was in 2009 co-incidentally when both the parties gave the nomination to an equal number of female candidates i.e. 43.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Obstacles to Women Participation in Politics and the Role of Media in Changing the Societal Mindset<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main obstacles is the societal obstacle. It is mainly believed that the main work of a female is to do household chores and child care and keep herself within the boundary of the house. Managing the outside world is the work of a male. It is also believed that women have a lack of ability in case of giving leadership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the advancement of news media, print media and social media are playing an important role in changing the mindset of society. Women participating in mainstream politics not just of political awareness but also the role of media in breaking the stereotyped image of women. Undoubtedly media has played a vital role in creating awareness among women and in empowering them up to some extent. Media helps women in identifying and adopting the ways of self-actualization. Women are also becoming active in the journalism profession previously they were seen rarely in journalism. It is also criticized to sensationalize the issues and use women as a commodity for seeking the attention of viewers. Women&#8217;s image is seen as submissive to men. Women&#8217;s issues rarely got space in the leading stories of front pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the above discussion, we can come to the conclusion that in spite of facing obstacles women in India is coming in the forefront and started demanding their own rights in various fields and many political and apolitical women organizations are acting as their agent in upholding their demands. One of the key thing that acts as an obstacle for women&#8217;s political participation in India is the lack of education. Women will come to know about their rights and privileges when they will get the proper education. With the objective of gender empowerment Government of India in 2014 formed a commission named National Mission of Empowerment of Women, but this project was not up to the mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side by side governmental help is for the uprising of women empowerment. As discussed earlier there are my constitutional provisions which provide equality between men and women. Recently in Kerala, the Sabarimala case is an example of governmental help that provided to the women. For many decades women were not allowed to enter into the Sabarimala temple but the LDF government protested against this and provide the equal right to women as like men to enter into the temple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media has to some extent plays an important for women empowerment and truly highlighting their status in society. Establishment of women panchayat and 33% reservation of women into the local bodies is acting as an encouragement to women for taking part in politics and in the decision making process.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reference<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Alam Shah, January 2015, International journal of advanced in management and social sciences, Volume 4, no.1, page 78.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Nisha M.Ameen, Vezhaventhan.
