The past week has been filled with geopolitical drama. Whether it be the United Kingdom officially leaving the European Union, which I am sure would have brought a smile to Charles De Gaulle, or whether it be a siege on the \u2018Temple of Democracy\u2019 itself. Of the many things one expected 2021 to behold, I am sure none expected such a dramatic start to the year. However, we as usual focus on what the Indian government is doing in the field of Foreign Policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>India-Turkmenistan Foreign Office Consultations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessworld.in\/article\/India-Turkmenistan-hold-foreign-office-consultations-discuss-economic-cooperation\/13-01-2021-365212\/\">Foreign Consultations<\/a> between the Indian Republic and Turkmenistan was held on the 13th of January, 2021.

The Indian government handed over a list of 263 Pakistani civilian prisoners and a list of 77 fishermen. The Pakistan government\u2019s list included 49 Indian Civilians and a total of 270 fishermen, who according to the Islamic Republic are Indians or believed to be Indians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon the exchange of lists, the Indian government asked to expedite the release and repatriation of 3 Indian civilian prisoners and 185 Indian fishermen, whose nationality has been confirmed and conveyed to Pakistan.

The Cyclone caused massive damage to the islands. In light of this natural calamity, the Indian government decided to provide humanitarian assistance through material aid. The relied material provided by the Indian government included shelter and hygiene kits, the government additionally also agreed to provide immediate assistance to the cyclone-affected communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A massive undertaking of this nature was possible owing to the work carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and were airlifted to the Fiji Islands, with the help of Air India and the Fiji Islands, through Sydney, Australia. India stood by Fiji during times of crisis and devastation, as this was not the first time that India provided the country assistance. Back in 2016, India was the leading nation to undertake humanitarian work on the islands following Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. India\u2019s actions speak of its commitment to provide Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief support to friendly Foreign Countries as a first responder. India\u2019s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific is in line with the Indo-Pacific Oceans initiative announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Telephone Conversation between Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of UK The Rt Hon Boris Johnson<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi conducted a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Boris Johnson.

Lastly, the heads of state reiterated their shared belief in the potential of the India-UK partnership in the post-Brexit, post-Covid context, and agreed to work towards a comprehensive roadmap for realizing this potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping aside the boiling tensions in the United States, we have noted a trend in geopolitical actions, wherein states have adopted a more cooperative attitude. This is particularly true with India, as can be seen through the points that we have covered in the report. In the coming months, it would be interesting to see the nature of the relationship that the Indian government develops with the Biden- Harris administration, and this would affect its policies in the Indo-pacific and the Middle East.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read<\/strong>: INDIA\u2019S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/indias-foreign-policy-report-edition-8\/\">EDITION #8<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The joy of stepping into a new decade was soon quashed, as nations struggled to maintain political stability and carry on parliamentary work.
