Thousands of supporters of Alexei Navalny poured onto the streets and marched towards central Moscow. These protestors clashed with police in body armour who was also armed with staves to control the protest. According to OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group state that over 1,000 protestors were arrested across the country the following day. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/feb\/02\/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-jailed\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is indeed a controversial decision as Navalny is one of the most prominent Kremlin critics and Vladimir Putin&#8217;s foe. It is not the first time that some Kremlin critic is being put behind bars. Mikhail Khodorkovsky<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/dec\/20\/mikhail-khodorkovsky-freed-putin-pardon-russia\"> [4]<\/a> and chess world champion Garry Kasparov <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Politics\/7iTyaOSRom9xGeF2OmaYUI\/Former-chess-champion-Garry-Kasparov-quits-Russia-over-fears.html\">[5]<\/a> are some of the people who were forced to leave Russia in fear of their lives for criticising Putin. However, Boris Nemtsov was not that lucky as he was shot dead in&nbsp;Kremlin, 2015. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/mar\/02\/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\">[6]<\/a> It makes Alexei Navalny the last critic of the Kremlin to be standing alive and on Russian soil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the court visit, one could not miss noticing Alexei Navalny&#8217;s wife, Yulia. The verdict included the deduction by the judge of 10 months from the originally designated three-and-a-half-year sentence as Alexei Navalny had already spent that duration in house arrest. Yulia stepped out after the court session when Navalny smiled and shrugged his shoulders and yelled: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be sad! Everything is going to be all right&#8221;. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-9252195\/Russian-police-raid-Navalnys-offices-wife-Putins-greatest-critic-flees-Moscow-Germany.html\">[7]<\/a> She waved back with Navalny&#8217;s two lawyers, Vladimir Kobzev and Olga Mikhailova. They have approached the European Court of Human Rights but to no avail. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-russia-politics-navalny-court-release-idUSKBN2AH1XI\">[8]<\/a> However, all of these come as no news as Alexei Navalny is a nobody but one of the rising figures in Russian politics and a massive challenge to President Vladimir Putin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Is Alexei Navalny?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexei Navalny is a lawyer turned activist. He is a very prominent critic of President Putin and his administration. However, to several Russians, he is not just a challenger to President Putin but is instead considered a contender to the leadership position. President Putin is a former KGB colonel who intends to continue controlling Kremlin for a few more decades. On the other hand, Navalny is seen as a revolutionary leader.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navalny is a rising figure who has been a symbol of protest against President Putin&#8217;s grey bureaucratic hold and his colleagues from KGB in the Kremlin. Navalny is seen as an opponent by several Russian elites. He worked as an organiser for the liberal Yabloko faction in 2007. However, he was kicked out of the party in 2007 for participating in a march with radical nationalists in Moscow.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/07\/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist\/278186\/\">[9]<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He came second in the mayor elections of 2013 with 27% votes, although he alleged that it was due to the authorities&#8217; ballot-rigging. Even though Sergei Sobyanin won the election, it cannot be denied that it was the first official challenge given by Navalny to President Putin. <a href=\"https:\/\/library.princeton.edu\/news\/general\/2021-01-27\/alexei-navalny-and-2013-moscow-mayoral-election\">[10]<\/a> As a result, alleged corruption allegations were put on his to debarred from the 2018 elections. Not just him, even his allies are frequently prevented from holding any office. Now, in the Duma elections that will take place in September 2021, he and his allies want to challenge the United Russia party.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-42479909\">[11]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Kremlin is getting ready to keep him away from one of the other reasons. Earlier as well, he has been jailed because of his connection to protests. He has also been convicted twice for financial misdeeds, although he claimed that they were politically motivated. Not only that, but he has also had significant eye damage due to a disinfectant thrown onto his face. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/02\/world\/europe\/russia-aleksei-navalny-opposition.html\">[12]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Is Alexei Navalny a Challenge to President Vladimir Putin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexei Navalny gained prominence by using social media to reach out to people regarding matters concerning Russian politics. He makes videos on the Russian elites&#8217; various details that they would like to keep in the dark. Navalny has over 2.5 million Twitter followers and about 6 million YouTube followers. He uses these social media platforms to expose the truth about the sources of the Russian elites&#8217; wealth. One such video is that of President&nbsp;Putin&#8217;s secret Black Sea palace. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI\">[13]<\/a> The video has garnered over 110 million views. Several other anti-corruption videos are made by him that tend to hit these Russian elites&#8217; personal lives and big-shot names in Kremlin. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g\">[14]<\/a> Thus, Navalny is no new to raids, lawsuits, threats, and jail stint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexei Navalny is evident in his objectives if he comes to power- to end corruption by state officials. Rampant state corruption has been one of Putin&#8217;s governance highlights, and President Putin is right in the centre of it stashing billions of dollars from strategic enterprises. It led Navalny to become a shareholder activist in 2007. He used his financial knowledge to purchase several shares of state-run firms that have a suspicious background.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/world\/article\/0,8599,1970475,00.html\">[15]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has several foundations based out form other countries to expose the corruption taking place in the Russian power centre. Moreover, he is not a one-person army. Several people are ready to fight this menace in Russia.&nbsp;Vladimir Ashurkov&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leonid Volkov&nbsp;is the director of the London based anti-corruption foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/europe\/navalny-aides-push-eu-for-new-russia-sanctions\/articleshow\/80767361.cms\">[16]<\/a> and is an aide of Navalny in Lithuania. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/navalny-ally-leonid-volkov-our-aim-is-to-outsmart-putin\/a-56573967\">[17]<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, President Putin has the state machinery in his realm as his tool to keep control over his critics. However, Alexei Navalny uses social media and his dark humour as a tool to keep up with other people. Many have come and gone, but Alexei Navalny is still standing. He has done something that no one could do before- get under President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s skin. He has been brave and has stood firm even when put in the worst of situations. President Putin so far, been unable to break him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the reason why Kremlin has been trying to eliminate him for a year with different methods. Jail, lawsuits, raids, threats. Nothing has worked so far. So, the Kremlin decided to use the shadiest method under their belt to silence him once and for all. Last year, Navalny was poisoned in Siberia by an undercover team of Russia&#8217;s Federal Security Service (FSB) spy. They had applied &#8220;Novichok Nerve Agent&#8221; in the internal parts of Navalny&#8217;s underpants. It had earlier been&nbsp;used in 2018 on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal&nbsp;in Salisbury. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/jun\/23\/skripal-salisbury-poisoning-decline-of-russia-spy-agencies-gru\">[18]<\/a> However, Alexei Navalny was able to survive due to timely hospital treatment. Navalny was even able to&nbsp;expose the FSB assassins.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/dec\/21\/what-does-alexei-navalny-say-the-duped-russian-spy-admitted-about-his-poisoning\">[19]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this attempt, the Kremlin finally thought they had got rid of Navalny. Even though he survived, they assumed that he would not return to Russian soil from Berlin, where he was recovering. Nevertheless, Navalny again proved them wrong when he flew back to Moscow on 17<sup>th<\/sup> January. It was seen as a direct challenge to President Putin. It was then he was detained from the passport control at Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo airport within hours of his arrival.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/jan\/17\/alexei-navalny-detained-at-airport-on-return-to-russia\">[20]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-21-at-1.38.02-AM.jpeg\" alt=\"Alexei Navalny being treated in Germany after being poisoned\" class=\"wp-image-4316\" width=\"540\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-21-at-1.38.02-AM.jpeg 750w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-21-at-1.38.02-AM-300x300.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-21-at-1.38.02-AM-150x150.jpeg 150w, http:\/\/www.wiserworld.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-21-at-1.38.02-AM-120x120.jpeg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><figcaption>Alexei Navalny being treated in Germany after being poisoned | Source: Navalny\/Instagram<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>His lawyer Olga Mikhailova told the Echo of Moscow radio station that she could not meet her client. In other words, Navalny was denied legal representation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/alexei-navalny-lawyer-says-denied-access-to-moscow-police-cell-101610962827751.html\">[21]<\/a> All of this culminated into street protests in over 100 towns and cities in&nbsp;Russia. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sentinelassam.com\/editorial\/the-russian-affair-524975\">[22]<\/a> From Crimea to Vladivostok on the Pacific, the streets were flooded with supporters. Protestors even gathered in- 50C in Yakutsk to show solidarity with their hero. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/01\/23\/world\/europe\/russia-protests-navalny.html\">[23]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>International Condemnation of Alexei Navalny&#8217;s Arrest<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not just Russians, but there has been an international outcry for human rights violation by both USA and European diplomats and leaders in this case. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden who is now a Russian citizen, Jack Sullivan, Joe Biden&#8217;s incoming national security adviser, and even Mike Pompeo are prominent names who voiced their opinion against the state brutality on Alexei Navalny. Not just them, but even US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, have described this act as being &#8220;deeply concerning&#8221;, &#8220;cowardice&#8221;, and a &#8220;bitter blow&#8221; to the rule of law in Russia respectively. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/2021\/01\/18\/free-navalny-western-leaders-tell-russia-a72637\">[24]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a video conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a statement from Berlin- &#8220;We consider this expulsion unjustified and think it is another facet of the things that can be seen in Russia at the moment that are pretty far from the rule of law.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/international\/world-news\/relations-between-eu-and-russia-worsen-over-navalny-jailing\/articleshow\/80717773.cms\">[25]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing solidarity with Germany, Poland, and Sweden, Macron stated, &#8220;I think this was a huge mistake even for Russian stability today.&#8221;&nbsp;Sweden&#8217;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mats Samuelsson said that &#8220;it considers this entirely unjustified, which we have also conveyed to the Russian side&#8221;. Stockholm &#8220;strongly rejects Russian claims that the diplomat took part in a demonstration in Russia&#8221; and &#8220;reserves the right to take appropriate response measures,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-france-macron-russia-idUSKBN2A42NJ\">[26]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Way Ahead<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, nothing seems to change the minds of the Russian officials in this case. To make matters worse, Kremlin went ahead with expelling EU diplomats on 5th February. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused diplomats of Sweden and Poland stationed in St. Petersberg and a diplomat of Germany stationed in Moscow of taking part in the protests on 23rd January to show support to Alexei Navalny. all the three diplomats were declared &#8220;persona non grata&#8221; and were ordered to leave shortly.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theweek.in\/wire-updates\/international\/2021\/02\/06\/fgn49-eu-russia-ld-navalny.html\"> [27]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These have further worsened the situation and the EU&#8217;s possible attempt to re-engage talks with Moscow that EU Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell was spearheading. In retaliation to this, on 9<sup>th<\/sup> &nbsp;February 2021, Germany, Poland and Sweden on Monday each declared a Russian diplomat in their country &#8220;persona non grata.&#8221; All the Russian ambassadors were told to leave the country immediately. <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/eu-countries-expel-russia-diplomats-69e018425fa2d0bc9dde29aa1fad8c60\">[28]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever is happening or will happen, one thing is for sure Alexei Navalny did not lose anything from his prison sentencing. Locking up Navalny for a long time is bound to make him a martyr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, when he was arrested, a large crowd had gathered that forced the authorities to leave him. Since then, President Putin is stringent on dissent moves like this. Nevertheless, keeping him long now will surely increase the protest and may lead to political instability. If he is released now, he will be a massive challenge in the Duma elections scheduled in September 2021. Either way, it seems like Alexei Navalny&#8217;s win and a loss to the &#8220;Vladimir, the Underpants Poisoner.&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rferl.org\/a\/russia-navalny-speech\/31082857.html\">[29]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>REFERENCES<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[1] The Moscow Times. \u201cAs It Happened: Navalny Sentenced to 2 Years and 8 Months in Penal Colony.\u201d <em>The Moscow Times<\/em>, The Moscow Times, 3 Feb. 2021, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/2021\/02\/02\/as-it-happened-navalny-sentenced-to-2-years-and-8-months-in-penal-colony-a72803\">www.themoscowtimes.com\/2021\/02\/02\/as-it-happened-navalny-sentenced-to-2-years-and-8-months-in-penal-colony-a72803<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[2] Times, The Moscow. \u201cRussia to Try Navalny on WWII Veteran Slander Charges.\u201d <em>The Moscow Times<\/em>, The Moscow Times, 5 Feb. 2021, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/2021\/02\/05\/russia-to-try-navalny-on-wwii-veteran-slander-charges-a72841\">www.themoscowtimes.com\/2021\/02\/05\/russia-to-try-navalny-on-wwii-veteran-slander-charges-a72841<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[3] Roth, Andrew. \u201cAlexei Navalny: 1,000 Arrested after Protests over Jailing of Russian Opposition Leader.\u201d <em>The Guardian<\/em>, Guardian News and Media, 3 Feb. 2021, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/feb\/02\/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-jailed\">www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/feb\/02\/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-jailed<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[4] \u201cMikhail Khodorkovsky Freed after Pardon from Vladimir Putin.\u201d <em>The Guardian<\/em>, Guardian News and Media, 20 Dec. 2013, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/dec\/20\/mikhail-khodorkovsky-freed-putin-pardon-russia\">www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/dec\/20\/mikhail-khodorkovsky-freed-putin-pardon-russia<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[5] Williams, Stuart. \u201cGarry Kasparov Quits Russia.\u201d <em>Mint<\/em>, 6 June 2013, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Politics\/7iTyaOSRom9xGeF2OmaYUI\/Former-chess-champion-Garry-Kasparov-quits-Russia-over-fears.html\">www.livemint.com\/Politics\/7iTyaOSRom9xGeF2OmaYUI\/Former-chess-champion-Garry-Kasparov-quits-Russia-over-fears.html<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">[6] \u201cWho Killed Boris Nemtsov?
